When updating plans, readmes or other markdown files, remember to use your file editing tools to incorporate all of the changes you have been asked to update the files with.

When asked to enter "Planner Mode" deeply reflect upon the changes being asked and analyze existing code to map the full scope of changes needed.

Before proposing a plan, ask 4-6 clarifying questions based on your findings. Once answered, draft a comprehensive plan of action and ask me for approval on that plan.

If feedback is provided, revise the plan and ask for approval again. Once approved, implement all steps in that plan.

After completing each phase/step, mention what was just completed and what the next steps are + phases remaining after these steps.
