Okay, let's break down how to use `git worktree` for comparing, modifying, and creating a pull request (PR) in your described scenario, step-by-step, based on the Git documentation and best practices.

**Assumptions:**

*   You have a Git repository initialized in a directory (let's call it `my-project`).
*   You have two branches: `feature-branch-1` and `feature-branch-2`.
*   You have Git installed and configured.
*   You have VS Code installed.
*   You are working on a non-bare repository (a regular repository with a working directory).
*   You are using a Git hosting service that supports pull requests (e.g., GitHub, GitLab, Bitbucket).

**Step-by-Step Instructions:**

**1. Create Worktrees for Each Branch:**

   *   **Navigate to your main repository directory:** Open your terminal (or Git Bash) and navigate to the root directory of your project (`my-project`). This is where your `.git` directory is located.  This is your *main working tree*.

        ```bash
        cd my-project
        ```

   *   **Create a worktree for `feature-branch-1`:**  Use the `git worktree add` command.  We'll create a new directory `../feature-1-wt` *outside* of your main project directory.  The `../` is crucial here; it prevents nesting worktrees, which is disallowed.

        ```bash
        git worktree add ../feature-1-wt feature-branch-1
        ```
        This command does the following:
           *   Creates a new directory `../feature-1-wt`.
           *   Checks out `feature-branch-1` into that directory.
           *   Sets up the necessary links to your main repository (so it's *not* a clone).

   *   **Create a worktree for `feature-branch-2`:** Repeat the process for the second branch.

        ```bash
        git worktree add ../feature-2-wt feature-branch-2
        ```

**Workflow: Create a new worktree that starts from a specific commit hash**

   *   **Capture the commit hash you want to branch from:** Run `git log --oneline` (or your preferred history viewer) in the main repository to copy the commit hash that should become the base for your new work.
   *   **Create and check out the branch in a new worktree with a single command:** Supply `-b` with the branch name you want, and pass the commit hash as the final argument. Example:

        ```bash
        git worktree add ../feature-from-commit-wt -b feature/from-commit abc1234
        ```

        This creates `../feature-from-commit-wt`, initializes a new branch named `feature/from-commit`, and points that branch at commit `abc1234` so you can start committing immediately.
   *   **Open the worktree and verify:** `cd ../feature-from-commit-wt` and run `git status` to confirm you are on the new branch with a clean tree before you begin editing.

**2. Open Both Worktrees in VS Code:**

   *   **Method 1: Open Folders Individually:**
        *   Open VS Code.
        *   Go to `File > Open Folder...` (or use the `Ctrl+K Ctrl+O` / `Cmd+K Cmd+O` shortcut).
        *   Navigate to and select the `../feature-1-wt` directory.  VS Code will open a new window for this worktree.
        *   Repeat the `File > Open Folder...` process and select the `../feature-2-wt` directory. You'll now have two VS Code windows, each representing a different worktree.
   *   **Method 2: Using the Command Line (if you have `code` in your PATH):**
        *   From your terminal, navigate into each worktree directory and use the `code .` command:
            ```bash
            cd ../feature-1-wt
            code .  # Opens feature-1-wt in VS Code
            cd ../feature-2-wt
            code .  # Opens feature-2-wt in a *new* VS Code window
            ```

**3. Compare and Selectively Modify `feature-branch-2`:**

   *   **Visual Comparison:** With both worktrees open in VS Code, you can use VS Code's built-in diffing capabilities:
        *   **File Explorer:** Navigate to the same file in both VS Code windows. You can visually compare them side-by-side.
        *   **Source Control Panel (Git):**  In the `feature-2-wt` window, the Source Control panel will show you any differences between the current state of `feature-branch-2` and its base.  You can click on a changed file to see a diff view.  This isn't directly comparing to `feature-branch-1`, but shows local modifications.
        *   **Integrated Terminal Diffs:** Use the `git diff` command in the integrated terminal of your `feature-2-wt` VS Code window:
            ```bash
            git diff feature-branch-1  # Diff the entire branch
            git diff feature-branch-1 -- path/to/file.txt  # Diff a specific file
            ```
            This provides a text-based diff, which can be very precise.

   *   **Selective Modification (File-by-File):**
        *   **Copy-Paste:** The simplest approach.  In the `feature-1-wt` VS Code window, open the file you want to copy from. Select the desired content and copy it.  In the `feature-2-wt` window, open the corresponding file, paste the copied content, and save.
        *   **VS Code's "Compare with..." Feature:** Right-click on a file in the `feature-2-wt` explorer, and choose "Select for Compare." Then, go to `feature-1-wt`, right-click the same file, and choose "Compare with Selected." This opens a powerful diff editor within VS Code. You can use the arrows and controls to copy changes between the files.
        *   **`git checkout` (for entire files):**  From the `feature-2-wt` directory in your terminal:
            ```bash
            git checkout feature-branch-1 -- path/to/file.txt
            ```
            This command overwrites `path/to/file.txt` in `feature-branch-2` with the version from `feature-branch-1`.  Be *very* careful with this; it overwrites the file without staging.

   *   **Selective Modification (Commit-by-Commit - Cherry-Picking):**
       *   Identify the commit hash(es) you want to apply from `feature-branch-1`. You can use `git log feature-branch-1` in the `feature-1-wt` directory to find them.

       *   In the `feature-2-wt` terminal:
            ```bash
            git cherry-pick <commit-hash>
            ```
            Replace `<commit-hash>` with the actual hash.  This applies the *changes* introduced by that specific commit to `feature-branch-2`.  If there are conflicts, Git will pause and ask you to resolve them (just like during a merge). You may need to `git cherry-pick --continue`, `git cherry-pick --skip`, or `git cherry-pick --abort` if conflicts occur.  Repeat this for each commit you want to cherry-pick.

       *  **Interactive Rebase (Advanced, but powerful):** For more complex scenarios where you need to reorder, squash, or edit commits before applying them, you can use interactive rebase. *Be cautious with interactive rebase if you've already pushed `feature-branch-2` to a remote, as it rewrites history.*
           *   From the `feature-2-wt` directory:
               ```bash
               git rebase -i feature-branch-1
               ```
               This will open your text editor with a list of commits. You can change the `pick` command to `reword`, `edit`, `squash`, `fixup`, or `drop` to modify the commits. Follow the instructions in the editor.

**4. Create a PR from the `feature-branch-2` Worktree:**

   *   **Commit and Push:** In the `feature-2-wt` terminal, stage and commit your changes:
        ```bash
        git add .  # Stage all changes, or be specific: git add path/to/file.txt
        git commit -m "Incorporate changes from feature-branch-1"
        git push origin feature-branch-2
        ```
        This pushes the modified `feature-branch-2` (from your worktree) to your remote repository.

   *   **Create the Pull Request:**
        *   Go to your Git hosting service's website (GitHub, GitLab, Bitbucket, etc.).
        *   Navigate to your repository.
        *   You should see a notification or button indicating that `feature-branch-2` has recently been pushed and offering to create a pull request.  Click it.
        *   Alternatively, go to the "Pull Requests" (or "Merge Requests") section and click "New Pull Request".
        *   Select `feature-branch-2` as the *source* branch and the branch you want to merge *into* (e.g., `main`, `develop`, or another feature branch) as the *target* branch.
        *   Fill in the title and description of your PR, explaining the changes you've made.
        *   Submit the pull request.

**5. Clean Up (Optional):**

   *   Once you're done with the worktrees, and the PR is merged (or you've decided you no longer need them), you can remove them:

        ```bash
        git worktree remove ../feature-1-wt
        git worktree remove ../feature-2-wt
        ```

   *  If you accidentally removed the worktree folders without the above command, run `git worktree prune` in your main repository.

**Important Considerations:**

*   **Conflict Resolution:** If you encounter merge conflicts during cherry-picking or rebasing, you'll need to resolve them manually. VS Code has excellent tools for this. Look for the conflict markers (`<<<<<<<`, `=======`, `>>>>>>>`) in the affected files, edit the files to choose the correct changes, and then stage and commit the resolved files.

*   **Branch Naming:** Keep your branch names descriptive and consistent.

*   **Worktree Location:** The use of `../` to place worktrees *outside* the main repository directory is crucial.  This avoids the nested worktree restriction.

*   **Remote Tracking:** Your worktrees are automatically set up to track the corresponding remote branches (assuming you've already set up remote tracking for those branches in your main repository).

*   **`.gitignore`:** The `.gitignore` file from your main repository applies to all worktrees.

* **Detached HEAD state:** If you checkout a specific commit (rather than a branch) in step 1, you'll be in a "detached HEAD" state within the new worktree. You should create a new branch from there, using `git switch -c <new-branch-name>` (or `git checkout -b <new-branch-name>` for older Git versions), *before* making any commits, or commits you make may get lost.

This comprehensive guide provides a practical, detailed approach to using `git worktree` for your comparison and modification workflow, including integration with VS Code and pull request creation. Remember to adapt the specific commands and paths to match your project's structure.
