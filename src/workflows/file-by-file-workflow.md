## 1. Explore the Codebase

* List relevant directories to show project structure.
* Review http://AGENTS[.]md, http://CLAUDE[.]md, and files under `docs/` for context and conventions.
* Check existing code for examples of similar implementations.

## 2. Ask Clarifying Questions

If anything is ambiguous, ask questions before finalizing the plan.
Examples:

* "Which module should the new helper live in?"
* "Should this endpoint return JSON or HTML?"

## 3. File Tree of Changes

At the top of the plan, show a tree diagram of affected files.
Use markers for status:

* UPDATE = update
* NEW = new file
* DELETE = deletion

Example:
```
/src
 ├── services
 │    ├── UPDATE user.service.ts
 │    └── NEW payment.service.ts
 ├── utils
 │    └── DELETE legacy-helpers.ts
 └── UPDATE index.ts
```

## 4. File-by-File Change Plan

For each file:

* Show full path + action (update, new, delete).
* Explain the exact changes in plain language.
* Include a short code snippet for the main update.

Example:

* File: `src/services/user.service.ts` (UPDATE)

  * Add a method `getUserByEmail(email: string)` that looks up a user from an in-memory list.
  * Refactor `getUserById` to reuse shared lookup logic.

  ```
  const users = [
    { id: 1, email: "alice@example[.]com", name: "Alice" },
    { id: 2, email: "bob@example[.]com", name: "Bob" },
  ];

  export function getUserByEmail(email: string) {
    return users.find(u => http://u[.]email === email) || null;
  }

  export function getUserById(id: number) {
    return users.find(u => http://u[.]id === id) || null;
  }
  ```

## 5. Explanations & Context

At the end of the plan, include:

* Rationale for each change (why it's needed).
* Dependencies or side effects to watch for.
* Testing suggestions to validate correctness.
