1. Start from a template:
* Clone a template from github or elswhere
* On cusor, you can do `start from repo` and paste this link to build a nextjs app prebuilt with AI features, database and authorization: https://github.com/ansh/template-2

2. Use agent mode in cursor to create, edit and manage files

3. Use Perplexity to find new designs and apis from the web. Say that you're creating a nextjs project and that you want to create XYZ feature, and to give you instructions AND code examples.

4. Keep agent chats in composer short. Break up distinct tasks into separate chats.

5. Run locally, test frequently, and make sure to commit to git often.

6. Iterate and refine - don't worry about getting it perfect the first time. Improve designs step by step.

7. Utilize voice to text to speed up development.

8. Clone and fork wisely: Use github repos as starting templates to accelerate development or find inspiration then customize.

9. Copy errors and paste into agent. When dealing with errors, over-explain the issue if not fixed the first time.

10. Revert to early versions if things go wrong.

11. Deploy early on platforms like vercel, netlify, etc. to make sure there are no issues on deployment.

12. Keep a record of the prompts that work best.
