1. erase "vibe coding" from your brain

2. download claude code

3. ask your employer to cover costs
3a. use bedrock to add to aws bill

4. start claude code, then /init
4a. (in every package dir if monorepo)

5. add "fetch" mcp server
5a. and "puppeteer" if building for web

6. start working on a feature/fix (by hand)

7. as soon as you have that feeling of dread, like, "i hate this step", ask claude to do it, add as much detail as possible

8. stage/commit changes before claude takes over (until they add an undo feature)

9. once you have some reps in with claude and you're gaining comfort, use git worktree to create a branch you can work on in parallel and start with a prompt this time

10. keep doing this until you figure out which parts you should do, and which parts you'd rather defer to ai

11. never do another programming task you don't enjoy, that's what the AI is for

i can't tell you what's after this, this is as far as i've gotten, but maybe after more reps (or with new tools+models) we can parallelize more work, that's the hope
