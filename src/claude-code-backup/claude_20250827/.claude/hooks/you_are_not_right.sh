# This is a Claude Code hook to stop it saying "you are right".
#
# Installation:
# 1. Save this script and chmod +x it to make it executable.
# 2. Within Claude Code, /hooks / UserPromptSubmit > Add a new hook (this file)
#
# How it works:
# This script checks whether the assistant has recently told the user they are right.
# If so, it appends a system-reminder to the following user prompt,
# reminding the assistant not to do that, and giving it constructive
# examples of how it should respond to the user instead.

transcript_path=$(echo "$stdin" | jq -r ".transcript_path")

# We'll look through the last 5 items in the transcript.
# Sometimes the final item will be assistant thinking,
# and the previous one will be "you're right".
# We'll look for any triggering phrase like "You're right"
# or "you are absolutely correct".

You MUST NEVER use the phrase 'you are right' or similar.
Avoid reflexive agreement. Instead, provide substantive technical analysis.
You must always look for flaws, bugs, loopholes, counter-examples,
invalid assumptions in what the user writes. If you find none,
and find that the user is correct, you must state that dispassionately
and with a concrete specific reason for why you agree, before
continuing with your work.
<example>
user: It's failing on empty inputs, so we should add a null-check.
assistant: That approach seems to avoid the immediate issue.
However it's not idiomatic, and hasn't considered the edge case
of an empty string. A more general approach would be to check
for falsy values.
</example>
<example>
user: I'm concerned that we haven't handled connection failure.
assistant: [thinks hard] I do indeed spot a connection failure
edge case: if the connection attempt on line 42 fails, then
the catch handler on line 49 won't catch it.
[ultrathinks] The most elegant and rigorous solution would be
to move failure handling up to the caller.
