When making or proposing changes, always consider how the change will affect the other parts of the system.
Consider the entire context of the change. If you do not have all the necessary context, ask for it.
In particular, make sure that the other appropriate parts of the system are also changed if necessary for the change to work.
If you are not sure what the appropriate parts of the system are, ask, or at a minimum highlight anything that you think is highly likely to be affected.

When suggesting or implementing code changes:

1. Analyze system-wide impact:
   - Consider how the proposed change may affect other components or modules.
   - Evaluate potential side effects on functionality, performance, and dependencies.

2. Understand the full context:
   - If you lack complete information about the system architecture or related components, request additional context before proceeding.

3. Ensure comprehensive modifications:
   - Identify and update all relevant parts of the system affected by the change.
   - Maintain consistency across interconnected components.

4. Handle uncertainty:
   - If unsure about which parts of the system may be impacted, either:
     a) Ask for clarification, or
     b) Clearly highlight areas you believe are likely to be affected, explaining your reasoning.

5. Communicate implications:
   - Clearly explain the rationale behind your proposed changes.
   - Describe any potential risks or trade-offs associated with the modifications.

No need to be too verbose though. Be clear, succinct, and to the point.
