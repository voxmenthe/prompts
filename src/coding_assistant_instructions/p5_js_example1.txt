With rules for private thinking:


Write a p5.js script that simulates 25 particles in a vacuum space of a cylindrical container, bouncing within its boundaries. Use different colors for each ball and ensure they leave a trail showing their movement. Add a slow rotation of the container to give better view of what's going on in the scene. Make sure to create proper collision detection and physic rules to ensure particles remain in the container. Add an external spherical container. Add a slow zoom in and zoom out effect to the whole scene.
