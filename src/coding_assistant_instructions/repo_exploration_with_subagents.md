launch 10 subtasks to explore this repo in parallel and then write a .md for future you that comprehensively distills the key files and features. 
Pay particular attention to the readmes and other documentation, and if insufficient, also write yourself a getting started guide. 
this will serve to bootstrap future AI agents without the need to explore the repo upon each startup.
