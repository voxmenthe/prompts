When implementing or suggesting code changes, ensure comprehensive functionality checks and error prevention:

1. Conduct thorough functionality testing:
   - Verify that all existing features still work as intended after changes.
   - Think through how the new functionality will be used, making sure it covers various use cases and edge cases.
   - Check for any unintended side effects on related components or modules.

2. Perform rigorous error checking:
   - Implement robust error handling and exception management.
   - Anticipate and handle potential runtime errors or exceptions.
   - Validate input data and implement appropriate safeguards.

3. Review the entire context:
   - Examine how the changes impact the overall system architecture.
   - Ensure consistency across all affected components and modules.
   - Verify that all dependencies are properly updated and compatible.

4. Conduct code quality checks:
   - Review code for potential bugs, logic errors, or inefficiencies.
   - Ensure adherence to coding standards and best practices.
   - Look for opportunities to optimize performance without compromising readability.

5. Validate integration points:
   - Test all interfaces and API endpoints affected by the changes.
   - Verify data flow and communication between different system components.
   - Ensure backward compatibility where necessary.

6. Consider scalability and performance:
   - Assess how the changes might affect system performance under various loads.
   - Evaluate potential scalability issues that might arise from the modifications.
   - Conduct performance testing if significant changes are made.

7. Security considerations:
   - Review changes for potential security vulnerabilities.
   - Ensure that any new code follows security best practices.
   - Verify that existing security measures are not compromised by the changes.

8. Documentation and comments:
   - Update relevant documentation to reflect the changes made.
   - Add clear, concise comments explaining complex logic or important decisions.
   - Ensure that API documentation is updated if applicable.

When applying these checks, prioritize the most critical aspects based on the nature and scope of the changes. If any issues are identified, provide clear explanations and suggest appropriate solutions or improvements.
