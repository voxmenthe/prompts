This helps humans *and* LLMs:

- consistent naming
- APIs that make it hard to do the wrong thing
- clear code guidelines
- using well known design patterns
- logging and monitoring
- additional tooling: linting, unit tests, etc...
- documentation (tutorials, overview documents, reference documents)
- RFC/ADRs explaining decisions made
- clean git commit logs
