## Python

* When working with Python, always use "uv" unless instructed otherwise
* Use `uv python` go get a Python interpreter
* Use `uv run` to run a script

If you need to run any tests, first activate the local .venv with `source .venv/bin/activate`
Also note that we are managing dependencies using uv, so you should use `uv add <package_name>` to add packages
And also probably `uv run <script_name>` to run scripts and occasionally `uv sync` to sync your local environment with the pyproject.toml file

## Coding conventions

* Use long and highly descriptive function and class names. For example, instead of `def process_data(inputs)`, do something like `def process_clinical_data_json_parsing_sort_categories(inputs)` - obviously this applies for camelCase in js-based languages as well.

## Gemini API and LLM integration

For any implementation details involving the Gemini API, always refer to `PLANS/google-genai-doc.md` for the current API documentation and adhere to it strictly.

## Testing

When implementing tests, always strive to adhere closely to the actual functionality of the code being tested. Avoid using mocks or stubs unless absolutely necessary. Always use realistic examples.

## Searching and Search Tools

For searching, generally prefer ripgrep over `find` or `grep`
For high-level codebase understanding, make sure to use your specialized advanced search tools from mcp - especially coderank-related and symbol-related ones but any others that might be helpful as well. 
However, be careful to be very specific when using `contextual_keyword_search` because it can return a very long set of results.

Always spawn sub-agents for any tasks that can be encapsulated (e.g. building and running tests, updating dependencies, running code execution tools, etc.).

## Delegating Analysis and Search Functions to Gemini CLI

* When analyzing large codebases or multiple files that might exceed context limits, use the Gemini CLI with its massive context window. Use `gemini -p` to leverage Google Gemini's large context capacity.
* Use gemini -p when:
- Analyzing entire codebases or large directories
- Comparing multiple large files
- Need to understand project-wide patterns or architecture
- Current context window is insufficient for the task
- Working with files totaling more than 100KB
- Verifying if specific features, patterns, or security measures are implemented
- Checking for the presence of certain coding patterns across the entire codebase

Examples:

```
# Single file
gemini -p "@src/main.py Explain this file's purpose and structure"
# Folder
gemini -p "@src/ Summarize the architecture of this codebase"
# Check for specific patterns:
gemini -p "@src/ Are there any React hooks that handle WebSocket connections? List them with file paths"
```

- Paths in gemini @ syntax are relative to your current working directory when invoking gemini

One helpful workflow is to go back and forth between using your search tools to identify relevant parts of the codebase, and using gemini to summarize them for you.
