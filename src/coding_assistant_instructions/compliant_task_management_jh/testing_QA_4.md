# Testing & Quality Assurance

This document defines the testing strategy, quality standards, and documentation requirements to ensure high-quality software delivery while enabling AI agents to contribute effectively to test planning and execution.

## 1. Testing Philosophy

### 1.1 Core Testing Principles
1. **Risk-Based Approach**: Prioritize testing based on complexity, criticality, and failure impact
2. **Test Pyramid Adherence**: Balance unit, integration, and E2E tests appropriately
3. **Clarity and Maintainability**: Tests should be self-documenting and easy to maintain
4. **Automation First**: Automate tests wherever feasible
5. **Continuous Validation**: Tests run on every change

### 1.2 AI Agent Testing Contributions
The AI_Agent should:
1. Suggest comprehensive test scenarios
2. Identify edge cases humans might miss
3. Generate test data and fixtures
4. Propose testing strategies based on code analysis
5. Create test documentation templates

## 2. Test Scoping and Strategy

### 2.1 Unit Tests
**Focus**: Individual functions, methods, or classes in isolation

**Scope**:
- Core business logic
- Utility functions
- Data transformations
- Error handling paths

**AI Agent Contributions**:
- Generate comprehensive test cases
- Identify boundary conditions
- Suggest mock strategies
- Create parameterized tests for multiple scenarios

**Example Test Plan** (Simple):
```markdown
## Test Plan
- Verify function compiles without errors
- Test happy path with valid inputs
- Test error handling with invalid inputs
- Verify TypeScript types are correct
```

### 2.2 Integration Tests
**Focus**: Multiple components working together

**Scope**:
- API endpoints with service layers
- Database interactions
- Message queue operations
- External service integrations

**Mocking Strategy**:
- Mock external third-party services
- Use real test instances for internal infrastructure
- Avoid deep mocking of database/queue clients

**AI Agent Contributions**:
- Design integration test scenarios
- Suggest test data that exercises component interactions
- Identify timing and race condition tests
- Propose contract testing approaches

**Example Test Plan** (Complex):
```markdown
## Test Plan
### Objectives
- Verify enrichment pipeline handles failures gracefully
- Test circuit breaker state transitions
- Validate retry logic with backoff

### Test Scope
- EnrichmentService class
- CircuitBreaker implementation
- pg-boss job handling

### Key Scenarios
1. **Success Path**: URL processes successfully
2. **Service Failure**: Firecrawl returns 5xx error
3. **Circuit Break**: Multiple failures trigger circuit break
4. **Recovery**: Circuit breaker half-open to closed transition

### Success Criteria
- All scenarios pass
- No resource leaks
- Performance within 2s per operation
```

### 2.3 End-to-End Tests
**Focus**: Complete user workflows

**Scope**:
- Critical user journeys
- Cross-system workflows
- User interface interactions

**AI Agent Contributions**:
- Map user stories to E2E test scenarios
- Suggest test data for realistic workflows
- Identify UI element selectors
- Propose visual regression tests

## 3. Test Documentation Standards

### 3.1 Test Plan Proportionality

#### Simple Tasks (constants, interfaces, configuration)
```markdown
## Test Plan
- TypeScript compilation passes
- Values are accessible at runtime
- No runtime errors when imported
```

#### Medium Tasks (basic features, simple integrations)
```markdown
## Test Plan
- Function registration succeeds
- Basic workflow executes correctly
- Error handling follows project patterns
- Performance meets requirements
```

#### Complex Tasks (multi-service integration, complex logic)
```markdown
## Test Plan
### Objectives
[Specific verification goals]

### Test Scope
[Components and interactions covered]

### Environment & Setup
[Test environment configuration]

### Mocking Strategy
[What to mock and why]

### Key Test Scenarios
[Detailed scenarios with expected outcomes]

### Success Criteria
[How to determine pass/fail]
```

### 3.2 AI Agent Test Plan Enhancement
For each test plan, the AI should:
1. Validate completeness against requirements
2. Suggest missing test scenarios
3. Identify potential flaky test risks
4. Recommend test data strategies
5. Propose performance benchmarks

## 4. Test Implementation Guidelines

### 4.1 Test File Organization
```
test/
├── unit/
│   └── [mirrors source structure]
├── integration/
│   └── [organized by feature/module]
├── e2e/
│   └── [organized by user journey]
└── fixtures/
    └── [shared test data]
```

### 4.2 Test Naming Conventions
- Descriptive test names that explain the scenario
- Use "should" statements for clarity
- Group related tests in describe blocks
- Include context in test names

### 4.3 AI Agent Test Generation
When generating tests, the AI should:
1. Follow project testing patterns
2. Include positive and negative cases
3. Test edge cases and boundaries
4. Add performance assertions where relevant
5. Include helpful error messages

## 5. Quality Gates and Standards

### 5.1 Code Coverage Requirements
- Minimum 80% code coverage for new code
- 100% coverage for critical business logic
- Coverage reports generated automatically

### 5.2 Test Quality Metrics
The AI Agent should monitor:
1. Test execution time trends
2. Flaky test occurrences
3. Coverage gaps
4. Test maintainability issues

### 5.3 Continuous Quality Improvement
The AI should suggest:
1. Test refactoring opportunities
2. Common assertion helpers
3. Test data factory patterns
4. Parallel test execution strategies

## 6. PBI-Level Testing Strategy

### 6.1 End-to-End CoS Testing
Each PBI must include a dedicated E2E test task:
- Named: `<PBI-ID>-E2E-CoS-Test`
- Verifies all Conditions of Satisfaction
- Tests complete user workflows
- Includes performance validation

### 6.2 Test Distribution Strategy
- Individual tasks: Focus on component functionality
- E2E CoS task: Comprehensive workflow validation
- Avoid test duplication across tasks
- Concentrate complex scenarios in dedicated test tasks

### 6.3 AI Agent E2E Test Design
For E2E tests, the AI should:
1. Map CoS to specific test scenarios
2. Design realistic user workflows
3. Include error recovery scenarios
4. Suggest performance benchmarks
5. Identify visual testing needs

## 7. Test Execution and Reporting

### 7.1 Automated Test Execution
- All tests run on commit
- Failed tests block merge
- Performance tests run nightly
- E2E tests run on staging deploys

### 7.2 Test Reporting

1. Test execution summaries
2. Coverage trend analysis
3. Performance regression alerts
4. Flaky test reports
5. Test maintenance recommendations

## 8. Special Testing Considerations

For performance-critical features:
1. Define performance requirements upfront
2. Include performance tests in task definition
3. Monitor performance trends
4. Alert on regressions

### 8.2 Security Testing
