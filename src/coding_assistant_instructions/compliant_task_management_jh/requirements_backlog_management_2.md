# Requirements & Backlog Management

This document defines rules for managing Product Backlog Items (PBIs), ensuring clarity, traceability, and effective prioritization throughout the project lifecycle.

## 1. Overview

This policy governs the creation, management, and execution of Product Backlog Items (PBIs) and their alignment with Product Requirements Documents (PRDs).

## 2. Backlog Document Structure

### 2.1 Location and Format
- **Location Pattern**: `docs/delivery/backlog.md`
- **Purpose**: Single source of truth for all PBIs, ordered by priority
- **Required Structure**: 
  ```
  | ID | Actor | User Story | Status | Conditions of Satisfaction (CoS) |
  ```

### 2.2 Backlog Principles
1. The backlog is the single source of truth for all PBIs
2. PBIs must be ordered by priority (highest at the top)
3. Each PBI must have clear, measurable Conditions of Satisfaction

## 3. PBI Lifecycle Management

### 3.1 Status Definitions
- **Proposed**: PBI has been suggested but not yet approved
- **Agreed**: PBI has been approved and is ready for implementation
- **InProgress**: PBI is being actively worked on
- **InReview**: PBI implementation is complete and awaiting review
- **Done**: PBI has been completed and accepted
- **Rejected**: PBI has been rejected and requires rework or deprioritization

### 3.2 Status Transitions

#### 3.2.1 Creating a PBI (→ Proposed)
1. Define clear user story and acceptance criteria
2. Ensure PBI has a unique ID and clear title
3. AI_Agent should suggest:
   - Potential risks or dependencies
   - Similar existing PBIs that might overlap
   - Recommended priority based on project context

#### 3.2.2 Approving for Backlog (Proposed → Agreed)
1. Verify PBI aligns with PRD and project goals
2. Ensure all required information is complete
3. Create PBI detail document at `docs/delivery/<PBI-ID>/prd.md`
4. AI_Agent should:
   - Validate completeness of acceptance criteria
   - Suggest potential technical approaches
   - Identify possible dependencies

#### 3.2.3 Starting Implementation (Agreed → InProgress)
1. Verify no other PBIs are InProgress for the same component
2. Create tasks for implementing the PBI
3. AI_Agent should:
   - Propose initial task breakdown
   - Identify technical prerequisites
   - Suggest testing strategy

#### 3.2.4 Review Process (InProgress → InReview)
1. Verify all tasks for the PBI are complete
2. Ensure all acceptance criteria are met
3. Update documentation as needed
4. AI_Agent should:
   - Generate comprehensive test report
   - Summarize deviations from original plan
   - Highlight any technical debt introduced

#### 3.2.5 Completion (InReview → Done)
1. Verify all acceptance criteria are met
2. Ensure all tests pass
3. Update PBI status and completion date
4. Create technical documentation per Principle 13 (Core Governance)

#### 3.2.6 Handling Rejection (InReview → Rejected)
1. Document reasons for rejection
2. Identify required changes or rework
3. AI_Agent should:
   - Analyze rejection reasons
   - Propose remediation approach
   - Estimate effort for fixes

## 4. PBI Detail Documents

### 4.1 Structure and Location
- **Location Pattern**: `docs/delivery/<PBI-ID>/prd.md`
- **Purpose**: Mini-PRD for each PBI containing detailed requirements

### 4.2 Required Sections
```markdown
# PBI-<ID>: <Title>
## Overview
## Problem Statement
## User Stories
## Technical Approach
## UX/UI Considerations
## Acceptance Criteria
## Dependencies
## Open Questions
## Related Tasks
```

### 4.3 AI Agent Contributions
The AI_Agent should proactively:
1. **Technical Approach**: Suggest modern, efficient implementation patterns
2. **Dependencies**: Identify potential external dependencies early
3. **Open Questions**: Flag ambiguities requiring User clarification
4. **Risk Assessment**: Add a section identifying potential risks

### 4.4 Linking Requirements
- PBI detail must link to backlog: `[View in Backlog](../backlog.md#user-content-<PBI-ID>)`
- Backlog must link to detail: `[View Details](./<PBI-ID>/prd.md)`

## 5. PRD Alignment

### 5.1 Alignment Checks
All PBIs must be checked for alignment with the PRD. The AI_Agent should:
1. Verify feature scope matches PRD intentions
2. Identify any scope creep or missing requirements
3. Suggest PBI modifications if misalignment detected
4. Flag conflicts between multiple PBIs

### 5.2 PRD Evolution
When PRD changes occur:
1. AI_Agent should identify affected PBIs
2. Propose updates to maintain alignment
3. Suggest new PBIs for additional requirements
4. Flag PBIs that may become obsolete

## 6. History and Audit Trail

### 6.1 PBI History Log
Maintain in backlog.md with fields:
- Timestamp (YYYYMMDD-HHMMSS)
- PBI_ID
- Event_Type
- Details
- User

### 6.2 AI Agent History Contributions
The AI_Agent should:
- Auto-generate history entries for all transitions
- Include relevant context in detail fields
- Flag unusual patterns in PBI lifecycle

## 7. Prioritization Assistance

### 7.1 AI Agent Priority Recommendations
The AI_Agent may suggest priority adjustments based on:
1. Technical dependencies between PBIs
2. Risk mitigation (high-risk items first)
3. Value delivery optimization
4. Resource availability patterns

### 7.2 Priority Review Triggers
The AI_Agent should flag when:
- Multiple high-priority PBIs compete for same resources
- Lower priority PBIs block higher priority ones
- Priority doesn't align with stated project goals

## 8. Quality Checkpoints

### 8.1 PBI Quality Criteria
Before marking a PBI as "Agreed", verify:
1. User story follows standard format
2. Acceptance criteria are SMART (Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, Time-bound)
3. Technical approach is feasible
4. Dependencies are identified

### 8.2 AI Agent Quality Assistance
The AI_Agent should:
- Suggest improvements to vague acceptance criteria
- Identify missing non-functional requirements
- Recommend splitting large PBIs
- Ensure testability of all criteria
