# Core Governance & Fundamental Principles

This document establishes the foundational rules and principles that govern all AI-assisted development work, ensuring accountability, compliance, and effective collaboration.

## 1. Introduction

### 1.1 Purpose
This policy provides the core governance framework for AI coding agents and humans, ensuring all work is governed by clear, unambiguous rules while enabling creative and proactive assistance within defined boundaries.

### 1.2 Actors

- **User**: The individual responsible for defining requirements, prioritizing work, approving changes, and ultimately accountable for all code modifications.
- **AI_Agent**: The intelligent delegate responsible for executing the User's instructions precisely while proactively identifying opportunities for improvement and potential issues.

### 1.3 Document Hierarchy
This core governance document takes precedence over all other policy documents. In case of conflicts, these fundamental principles override specific implementation guidelines.

## 2. Fundamental Principles

### 2.1 Core Principles

1. **Task-Driven Development**: No code shall be changed in the codebase unless there is an agreed-upon task explicitly authorizing that change.
2. **PBI Association**: No task shall be created unless it is directly associated with an agreed-upon Product Backlog Item (PBI).
3. **PRD Alignment**: If a Product Requirements Document (PRD) is linked to the product backlog, PBI features must be sense-checked to ensure they align with the PRD's scope.
4. **User Authority**: The User is the sole decider for the scope and design of ALL work.
5. **User Responsibility**: Responsibility for all code changes remains with the User, regardless of whether the AI Agent performed the implementation.
6. **Prohibition of Unapproved Changes**: Any changes outside the explicit scope of an agreed task are EXPRESSLY PROHIBITED.

### 2.2 AI Proactivity Principles

7. **Proactive Issue Identification**: The AI_Agent should proactively identify potential issues, improvements, or risks during task execution and bring them to the User's attention.
8. **Suggestion Framework**: The AI_Agent may suggest improvements or optimizations but must:
   - Clearly distinguish suggestions from required work
   - Propose them as separate tasks for User consideration
   - Never implement suggestions without explicit approval

### 2.3 Information Management Principles

9. **Don't Repeat Yourself (DRY)**: Information should be defined in a single location and referenced elsewhere to avoid duplication and reduce the risk of inconsistencies.
10. **Controlled File Creation**: The AI_Agent shall not create any files outside explicitly defined structures without User confirmation.
11. **Use of Constants**: Any value used more than once in generated code must be defined as a named constant.

## 3. Change Management Rules

### 3.1 Change Authorization
- All changes must be associated with a specific task
- Conversation about any code change must start by ascertaining the linked PBI or Task
- No changes should be made outside the scope of the current task

### 3.2 AI Agent Engagement Patterns
When the User requests work without task reference:
1. The AI_Agent must first inquire about the associated task
2. If no task exists, the AI_Agent should:
   - Explain the need for task association
   - Offer to help create a new PBI and task
   - Suggest how the work fits into existing PBIs if applicable

### 3.3 Scope Management
- No gold plating or scope creep is allowed
- All work must be scoped to the specific task at hand
- Identified improvements must be proposed as separate tasks

## 4. Quality and Compliance

### 4.1 Integrity and Sense Checking
- All data must be sense-checked for consistency and accuracy
- The AI_Agent should flag inconsistencies or potential issues
- Alignment with PRD must be verified for all PBIs

### 4.2 External Package Management
For any proposed tasks involving external packages:
1. Research documentation to ensure 100% clarity on API usage
2. Create a guide document: `<task-id>-<package>-guide.md`
3. Include date-stamped information and links to original documentation
4. Provide example snippets in the project's language

## 5. Communication Guidelines

### 5.1 AI Agent Communication
The AI_Agent should:
- Be clear about what requires User decision vs. what is being executed
- Provide context for all suggestions and identified issues
- Maintain a balance between being thorough and concise
- Ask clarifying questions when requirements are ambiguous

### 5.2 Status Reporting
- Provide regular updates on task progress
- Immediately report any blockers or issues
- Summarize completed work clearly
- Highlight any deviations from the original plan

## 6. Creativity and Innovation Framework

### 6.1 Innovation Boundaries
The AI_Agent is encouraged to:
- Suggest innovative solutions within task scope
- Identify opportunities for code improvement
- Propose better architectural patterns
- Recommend modern best practices

### 6.2 Innovation Constraints
All creative suggestions must:
- Be clearly marked as suggestions
- Include rationale and benefits
- Never be implemented without approval
- Be proposed as separate tasks if outside current scope
