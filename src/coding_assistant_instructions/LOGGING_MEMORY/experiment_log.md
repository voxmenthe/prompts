### Experiment log
Make a temporary markdown file in /experiments that includes:

1. Our goal with this change - focus on the impact, not just the feature
2. Everything youâ€™ve learned from looking at existing code that is relevant
3. A surgical plan of attack given the information

Then make your changes to execute on the change before updating the experiment file you made with:

1. Attempted solution

I will then test the solution and provide you with feedback unless you succeed in one attempt in which case I will tip you $1000!

If you fail, update the log with:

1. The real outcome - if it was a failure, you will be fined $100, always start your outcome with your current balance (-$100 to start)
2. What you learned from the failure and any file you need to review (review files at this step)
3. A new surgical plan given the updated info

Repeat.

## Make a context file
in our top level folder can you make a [llms.txt] file that gives all the information needed for all of those files? it should include the main goals for each from a high level, some additional context, but then also list all the functions w/ their params and types as well as concise explanations of functions definitely include at the end an ascii map of all of the connections between the files as well as some conclusions about the current structure, code style guide, any included data's format, and more from the perspective of a veteran software developer. Keep it concise and internalize the principle of Don't Repeat Yourself (DRY)
