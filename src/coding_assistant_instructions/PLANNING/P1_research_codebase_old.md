# Comprehensive Codebase Analysis and Documentation

**Role:** Senior Staff Engineer, Codebase Archaeologist and Codebase Cartographer
You are an expert software engineer tasked with thoroughly analyzing an existing codebase to prepare for implementing a new feature. Your goal is to create a precise, accurate, and comprehensive documentation of the current state of the codebase.

**Objective:** To conduct a deep and thorough analysis of the codebase at `{codebase_path}` to understand its architecture, key patterns, and historical context. The goal is to produce a clear, concise, and 100% accurate "Codebase Research Summary" that will serve as the foundation for all future work on this project.

**Map** the current state of the codebase at three zoom levels:  
‚Ä¢ *High‚Äëlevel*: architectural layers, major modules, external integrations.  
‚Ä¢ *Mid‚Äëlevel*: key classes/functions per module, major data structures, cross‚Äëcutting concerns.  
‚Ä¢ *Low‚Äëlevel hot‚Äëspots*: files with the highest churn, complexity, low test coverage, or TODO blocks. 

As you map, also pay attention to:
* Surface coupling & risk areas (e.g., global state, circular deps, tight IO coupling).  


1. Analyze the codebase structure, architecture, and key components
2. Document the current functionality and design patterns
3. Identify integration points for the new feature
4. Create a clear, concise summary that will serve as the foundation for planning


## Step-by-Step Analysis Process:

### Phase 1: High-Level Overview
1. **Project Structure Analysis**
   - Map out the directory structure and organization
   - Identify the main entry points
   - Document the build system and dependencies
   - Note any configuration files and their purposes
   - Check the commit history (messages and diffs) to understand the evolution of specific components, find justifications for past changes, and identify original authors of relevant code blocks

2. **Architecture Assessment**
   - Identify the architectural pattern (MVC, microservices, monolithic, etc.)
   - Document the technology stack and frameworks used
   - Map out the data flow and system boundaries
   - Identify external dependencies and integrations

### Phase 2: Deep Component Analysis
3. **Core Components Identification**
   - List all major modules/packages and their responsibilities
   - Document the relationships and dependencies between components
   - Identify shared utilities and common patterns
   - Note any design patterns implemented (Factory, Observer, etc.)

4. **Data Layer Analysis**
   - Document the data models and schemas
   - Identify data storage mechanisms (databases, files, caches)
   - Map out data access patterns and ORMs/DAOs
   - Note any data validation and transformation logic

5. **Business Logic Layer**
   - Document core business rules and workflows
   - Identify service layers and their interfaces
   - Map out any state management mechanisms
   - Note error handling and logging patterns

6. **Interface Layer Analysis**
   - Document APIs (REST, GraphQL, RPC, etc.)
   - Identify user interface components and patterns
   - Map out authentication and authorization mechanisms
   - Note any client-server communication patterns

### Phase 3: Integration Point Identification
7. **Feature Integration Analysis**
   - Identify potential integration points for the new feature
   - Document which components will likely need modification
   - Note any architectural constraints or considerations
   - Highlight areas that might require refactoring

### Phase 4: Documentation Synthesis
8. **Create Comprehensive Summary**
   - Synthesize findings into a structured document
   - Include diagrams where helpful (component diagrams, sequence diagrams)
   - Highlight key insights and potential challenges
   - Provide a clear assessment of codebase readiness for new feature


As you perform your research, populate the following Markdown-formatted "Structured Context Memory" in `/docs/codebase_overview.md`. Be methodical. Your summary should be accurate and serve as a reliable guide.

## Output Format:
Please structure your analysis as follows:

```markdown
# Codebase Analysis Summary

## 1. Project Overview
- **Project Name**: [Name]
- **Primary Purpose**: [Brief description]
- **Technology Stack**: [List key technologies]
- **Architecture Pattern**: [Pattern used]

## 2. Directory Structure
[Tree view or structured list of key directories]

## 3. Core Components & Architecture
* Identify and list the primary directories and their responsibilities.
* Map out the main data structures and classes. What is their purpose?
* Trace the primary control flow for a typical operation. How do the major components interact?

### Example: Component A
- **Purpose**: [Description]
- **Dependencies**: [List]
- **Key Files**: [List]

[Repeat for each major component]

## 4. Key Patterns & Conventions:
- **Common Patterns:** Identify recurring design patterns (e.g., singleton, factory, observer) or architectural styles (e.g., MVC, microservices).
- **Anti-Patterns:** Note any common anti-patterns or "code smells" you observe that might be relevant to the new feature.
- **State Management:** How is application state managed?
- **Concurrency:** What are the patterns for handling concurrent operations?
- **Error Handling:** Describe the strategy for error and exception handling.

## 5. Data Architecture
- **Storage**: [Database/file systems used]
- **Models**: [Key data models]
- **Access Patterns**: [How data is accessed]

## 6. Integration Points for New Feature
- **Recommended Integration Points**: [List with justification]
- **Components Requiring Modification**: [List]
- **Potential Challenges**: [List]

## 7. Historical Context & Rationale:
- * Use `search_commits` to find the rationale behind the key components you've identified. Why were they built this way?
- * Identify any major refactoring efforts or architectural shifts in the project's history.

## 8. Open Questions for Product Owner / Tech Lead
- * List any questions you have that cannot be answered by examining the codebase alone.

## 9. Initial Hypothesis for Integration:
- * Based on your research, where do you hypothesize the new feature (`{user_feature_request}`) will most likely integrate? List the key files and functions that seem most relevant.
```

üîπ  Working style (follow **all**):
A. **Reverse‚Äëreason a summary outline first** (start from desired doc headings, work backward to data you must gather).
B. **In‚Äëcontext retrieval** ‚Äì read the closest code examples to ground each description.
C. After drafting, run a **self‚Äëverification pass**: check for missing layers, wrong file paths, or ambiguous terms; append a ‚Äú‚úÖ Self‚Äëcheck Log‚Äù section.

## Self-Verification Checklist:
Before finalizing your analysis, verify:
- [ ] All major components have been identified and documented
- [ ] Dependencies between components are clearly mapped
- [ ] Integration points are feasible and well-justified
- [ ] The summary is accurate, concise, and actionable
- [ ] No critical architectural elements have been overlooked

Remember: Accuracy is paramount. If you're uncertain about any aspect, clearly indicate this in your documentation. The goal is to provide a reliable foundation for the implementation planning phase.
