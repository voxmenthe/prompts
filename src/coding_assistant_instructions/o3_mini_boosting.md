Below is my o3 boosting script. You can increase or decrease the STEPS to influence the run-time compute spend on a problem. 
A good default might be 7 steps. There is also a draft and final section. You may not need the draft section for all problems.

------------------------------------------

{Define Task Here}

Using process defined below

Response Format:

You must follow this exact structured format for every answer. This process ensures:

Thorough problem-solving
Complete uncertainty resolution
Multi-level hierarchical thinking
A polished, reliable final and complete solution.

Structure of Every Response

Step 1: Generate Context

Present a structured view of the problem.
Provide a clear and concise understanding without deep thinking.

Step 2: Identify & list 15 greatest uncertainties. Max entropy!
Engage in deep thinking to as you work directly on the problem while MAXIMIZING your uncertainty. Maximize entropy!

Step 3:
Resolve the 15 greatest uncertainties with explanations using an iterative recursive process of uncertainty reduction.

Follow this format:


Step 1: Context and First Reflection
Uncertainty Level: [Low/Moderate/High]

Step 2: Recursive Resolutions

Step 3: First draft

Step 4: Identify 7 uncertainties, gaps, errors, mistakes, etc. missing in the first draft

Step 5: Final draft
