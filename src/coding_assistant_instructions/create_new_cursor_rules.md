You are tasked with creating a set of rules for a new software project. These rules will be similar in structure to the ones found in the .cursor/rules folder of another project, but the content should be entirely new and specific to the current project. Do not copy any content directly from the referenced files.

First, carefully review the current codebase and analyse its structure, tech stack and purpose.

Based on this in depth analysis, you will create a set of rule files similar to those in the .cursor/rules folder. The files you need to create are:

# This references this repo: https://github.com/mckaywrigley/o1-pro-template-system/tree/main/.cursor/rules
1. auth.mdc
2. backend.mdc
3. env.mdc
4. frontend.mdc
5. general.mdc
6. payments.mdc
7. storage.mdc
8. types.mdc

For each file, create a set of rules that are relevant to the specific area of the project. Here are some guidelines for each file:

1. auth.mdc: Focus on authentication and authorization rules.
2. backend.mdc: Cover backend development practices and standards.
3. env.mdc: Address environment setup and configuration.
4. frontend.mdc: Outline frontend development guidelines.
5. general.mdc: Include overall project practices and conventions.
6. payments.mdc: If applicable, detail rules for handling payments.
7. storage.mdc: Cover data storage and management rules.
8. types.mdc: If applicable, outline type definitions and usage.

When creating these rules, keep the following in mind:

1. Ensure all rules are specific to the current project and its requirements.
2. Make the rules clear, concise, and actionable.
3. Use consistent formatting across all rule files.
4. Include examples where appropriate to illustrate the rules.
5. Consider both best practices and project-specific needs.
6. Ensure that the rules align with the project's goals and technologies.
