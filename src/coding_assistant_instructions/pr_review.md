I'm on a branch and what I need is a complete code review for this branch. You'll need to diff it from `main`, examine all the changes, and then first give me an overview of all the changes in the code. Then ask if I have any questions or want to dive deeper on a particular change. Then you may have to walk me through specific changes. I also want to hear your opinion of the changes -- are they sensible, do they make the code better or worse and why, could they be improved, are there any coding standards in our app that they fail to meet, etc.
