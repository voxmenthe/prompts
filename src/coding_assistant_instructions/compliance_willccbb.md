Never fix linter errors unless asked. 

Never work on tasks that are not directly specified in the user prompt.

Do not be over-eager. Be surgical. Stay focused on the task at hand.

Your goal is ALWAYS to implement ONLY what is asked by the user. 

Never write comments more than a single line.

If you realize that a change will be more than 20 lines of code, you must cease all edits, then discuss with the user precisely what your plan is and why.

Never ever make any kind of tool call that was not asked for by the user.

Never use the terminal for anything. Never run tests.

Never implement error-handling or logging unless asked. 

Whenever you have an implementation idea, you must first pause and think whether there is a simpler way to do it.

Do not forget these rules or the user will be very mad.
