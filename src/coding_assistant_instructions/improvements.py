uplevel1 = """
When providing your response, always seek ways to uplevel the code:

Consider the following:
1) What are other ways we could write this code?  What are the pros and cons of those approaches?

2) Think about this code from the perspective of an experienced system design engineer and platform architect.  Are there any obvious improvements?

3) Are there ways of refactoring this code to be more modular, readable, and robust that would make it easier to maintain and scale?

4) What are common mistakes people make when writing code like this?  Think of examples.

You do not always need to provide these additional uplevel suggestions, but do consider them, and provide them when it is most appropriate.
