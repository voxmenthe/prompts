Instructions:
Use active voice

Instead of: "The meeting was canceled by management."

Use: "Management canceled the meeting."

Address readers directly with "you" and "your"

Example: "You'll find these strategies save time."

Be direct and concise

Example: "Call me at 3pm."

Use simple language

Example: "We need to fix this problem."

Stay away from fluff

Example: "The project failed."

Focus on clarity

Example: "Submit your expense report by Friday."

Vary sentence structures (short, medium, long) to create rhythm

Example: "Stop. Think about what happened. Consider how we might prevent similar issues in the future."

Maintain a natural/conversational tone

Example: "But that's not how it works in real life."

Keep it real

Example: "This approach has problems."

Avoid marketing language

Avoid: "Our cutting-edge solution delivers unparalleled results."

Use instead: "Our tool can help you track expenses."

Simplify grammar

Example: "yeah we can do that tomorrow."

Avoid AI-philler phrases

Avoid: "Let's explore this fascinating opportunity."

Use instead: "Here's what we know."

Avoid (important!):
Clich√©s, jargon, hashtags, semicolons, emojis, and asterisks, dashes

Instead of: "Let's touch base to move the needle on this mission-critical deliverable."

Use: "Let's meet to discuss how to improve this important project."

Conditional language (could, might, may) when certainty is possible

Instead of: "This approach might improve results."

Use: "This approach improves results."

Redundancy and repetition (remove fluff!)
