## Basic Workflow 1
1. sketch out a rough idea for software with the help of Sonnet 3.5
2. ask Sonnet 3.5 to create a summary with all the functional and non-functional requirements
3. load that into o1-preview and prompt "create a step-by-step plan broken down into phases for how to implement this using requirements mentioned"
4. use an AI coding agent like OpenHands from @allhands_ai or @Replit agent and feed the plan created by o1-preview to it


## Coding a Web App
✅ I used v0 for designing frontend screens
✅ I used claude as coding guide
✅ I used bolt (instead of cursor) as IDE.

I went to dribbble to find a style inspiration for my new project.

Then, I pasted that screenshot in v0 and asked it to copy the style and code me these pages:
- Homepage
- Create New
- History
- Settings
- Support

(I added Product Development Doc PRD generated by Claude which explained all pages in depth)

So I got 5 pages Frontend code.
I attached that code to claude and now Claude is my coding assistant. 
I used to use cursor at this point but I wanted to experiment with bolt.
So I opened up bolt and treated it like cursor.
Attached PRD and asked it to install Nextjs + all required dependencies for the project.
Boom done in a minute.

Then I asked claude to give me directory structure following best bractices of Nextjs app router.
Pasted that in bolt and asked it to create all folders and files in the directory. 
Surprisingly, It didn't miss any file (cursor always miss that if you use composer and not terminal)

Now what i did was something different and it saved me alot of tokens.
Instead of asking bolt to code me the pages.
I went back to claude and asked it integrate supabase and provide me code for each page.
I copied the code and pasted in right files in bolt. 

After i was done. I wrote a prompt for bolt 
"Dont rewrite the code. Only fix errors. Use deep chain of thought reasoning to find root cause or errors and then fix them one by one. First analyze the code file, only fix errors in specific lines that are causing issues, don't regenerate complete code for that page"

(This prompt is important. If you have 100 lines of code on a page and you have an error in line 6. Bolt doesn’t fix line 6 but Regenerate whole page and rewrite 100 lines of code)

That's why bolt burns out tokens fast but this prompt worked well for me.

So it fixed all export errors, added shared components code added supabase in 1 go.

I spent $3 and I had my frontend backend connected in bolt in like 3 hours.

Then I should've taken the project out of bolt and used cursor to refine the code. 
But i stuck with bolt. I asked for refinements and added few features.
It did a pretty good job. Error handling has improved alot.
