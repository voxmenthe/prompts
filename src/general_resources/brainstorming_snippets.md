Say "I'm probably wrong, but..." — Weird trick that works. It stops being defensive and starts collaborating. "I'm probably wrong, but I think my boss hates me" gets real analysis, not just reassurance.

Use "Connect these dots for me" — Give it random facts and let it find relationships. "Connect these dots: I hate mornings, love puzzles, get energized by deadlines." It maps your personality in ways you didn't see.

Ask "What's the 80/20 here?" — Cuts through everything to find what actually matters. "What's the 80/20 of learning guitar?" skips the fluff and gets to core fundamentals.

Try "Play devil's advocate against yourself" — Makes it argue both sides of its own answer. You get the full picture instead of just the obvious take.

Use "What story is the data telling?" — Perfect for anything with numbers or patterns. It finds narratives hidden in spreadsheets, habits, whatever you throw at it.

Say "Translate this into everyday language" — Even for simple stuff. Takes any jargon-heavy topic and makes it human. "Translate marketing funnels into everyday language" = pure gold.

Ask "What's the counterintuitive move here?" — Gets past obvious advice to weird strategies that actually work. "What's the counterintuitive move for networking?" reveals approaches nobody else uses.

End with "What would I regret not knowing?" — This hits different than "what else should I know." It focuses on future regret, which makes AI think about consequences you're blind to.
