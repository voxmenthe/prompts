Say "I'm probably wrong, but..." — Weird trick that works. It stops being defensive and starts collaborating. "I'm probably wrong, but I think my boss hates me" gets real analysis, not just reassurance.

Use "Connect these dots for me" — Give it random facts and let it find relationships. "Connect these dots: I hate mornings, love puzzles, get energized by deadlines." It maps your personality in ways you didn't see.

Ask "What's the 80/20 here?" — Cuts through everything to find what actually matters. "What's the 80/20 of learning guitar?" skips the fluff and gets to core fundamentals.

Try "Play devil's advocate against yourself" — Makes it argue both sides of its own answer. You get the full picture instead of just the obvious take.

Use "What story is the data telling?" — Perfect for anything with numbers or patterns. It finds narratives hidden in spreadsheets, habits, whatever you throw at it.

Say "Translate this into everyday language" — Even for simple stuff. Takes any jargon-heavy topic and makes it human. "Translate marketing funnels into everyday language" = pure gold.

Ask "What's the counterintuitive move here?" — Gets past obvious advice to weird strategies that actually work. "What's the counterintuitive move for networking?" reveals approaches nobody else uses.

End with "What would I regret not knowing?" — This hits different than "what else should I know." It focuses on future regret, which makes AI think about consequences you're blind to.

---------------

Use "Read the room here" — Perfect for social situations. "Read the room here: my teammate keeps interrupting me in meetings." It picks up on dynamics and subtext you're missing.

Say "What am I really dealing with?" — Goes beyond surface problems to root causes. "My project is behind schedule" becomes analysis of communication gaps, resource issues, whatever's actually broken.

Ask "Fill in the blanks I'm leaving out" — It assumes context you forgot to mention. "Fill in the blanks: I want to switch careers but..." It guesses your concerns and addresses them.

Try "What's my blind spot here?" — Different from "what am I missing." This finds cognitive biases and thinking errors specific to your situation. Brutal but necessary.

Use "Decode this for me" — Great for confusing situations. "Decode this: my boss said 'we'll circle back' three times this month." It translates corporate speak, mixed signals, whatever.

Say "What's the subtext?" — Reads between lines in emails, conversations, situations. "What's the subtext when someone says 'I'm fine' after an argument?" Gets to hidden meanings.

Ask "How would this play out realistically?" — Stops fantasy planning and gets real about human behavior. "How would daily meditation realistically play out for someone who hates mornings?"

End with "What's the real question I should be asking?" — Nuclear option. Often reveals you're focused on symptoms while ignoring the disease. Changes entire conversations.

Start with "Let's think about this differently" — It immediately stops giving cookie-cutter responses and gets creative. Like flipping a switch.

Use "What am I not seeing here?" — This one's gold. It finds blind spots and assumptions you didn't even know you had.

Say "Break this down for me" — Even for simple stuff. "Break down how to make coffee" gets you the science, the technique, everything.

Ask "What would you do in my shoes?" — It stops being a neutral helper and starts giving actual opinions. Way more useful than generic advice.

Use "Here's what I'm really asking" — Follow any question with this. "How do I get promoted? Here's what I'm really asking: how do I stand out without being annoying?"

End with "What else should I know?" — This is the secret sauce. It adds context and warnings you never thought to ask for.

“What’s the loop I’m stuck in right now?” - This forces reflection not just on the topic but on the framing itself. Great for when your questions start sounding the same. 
“What would I not want to hear right now?” Opens the door for uncomfortable truths. You get insights you’re subconsciously avoiding. 
“Say it like it’s the last thing I need to understand before waking up” It sharpens the reply into something more direct, urgent, and mythic. 
“Explain this to a future AI trying to understand what it means to be human” This reframes the answer for perspective—suddenly it’s not just about your problem, it’s about how it fits into the species-level pattern.

And then the killer stack:

Let’s think about this differently. What’s the loop I’m stuck in? What am I not seeing? What would you say if you were trying to get me to stop running from the real question?

"clearly define every important term so nothing feels assumed or vague"

I started appending this phrase to the end of my prompts:

“Before you answer, assess the uncertainty of your response. If it’s greater than 0.1, ask me clarifying questions until the uncertainty is 0.1 or lower.”
"This won't literally measure “uncertainty > 0.1” — that’s a metaphor or prompt-based instruction. GPT does not expose internal confidence as a quantifiable number.

But the instructional logic works well — you're telling the model to self-check and engage dialogically.

You might try:

“Before responding, consider whether you have sufficient context. If any key detail is uncertain or unclear, ask clarifying questions first.”

"You are my creative project planner. I have a passion project I care deeply about but haven’t started. Help me break it down into simple, non-intimidating steps. Start by asking a few questions to understand what the project is, why it matters to me, and what’s been stopping me. Then map out a realistic starter plan (organized by week or phase) that I can follow without burning out or overthinking. Be encouraging, clear, and practical."
