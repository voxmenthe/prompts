# Realtime API with SIP

Connect to the Realtime API using SIP.

[SIP](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Session_Initiation_Protocol) is a
protocol used to make phone calls over the internet. With SIP and the
Realtime API you can direct incoming phone calls to the API.

## Overview

If you want to connect a phone number to the Realtime API,
use a SIP trunking provider (e.g., Twilio). This is a service that converts your phone call
to IP traffic. After you purchase a phone number from your SIP trunking
provider, follow the instructions below.

Start by creating a [webhook](/docs/guides/webhooks) for incoming calls, through your **platform.openai.com** [settings](https://platform.openai.com/settings) > Project > **Webhooks**.
Then, point your SIP trunk at the OpenAI SIP endpoint, using the project ID
for which you configured the webhook, e.g., `sip:$PROJECT_ID@sip.api.openai.com;transport=tls`.
To find your `$PROJECT_ID`, visit [settings](https://platform.openai.com/settings) > Project > **General**. That page will display the project ID, which
will have a `proj_` prefix.

When OpenAI receives SIP traffic associated with your project,
your webhook will be fired. The event fired will be a
[`realtime.call.incoming`](/docs/api-reference/webhook-events/realtime/call/incoming) event,
like the example below:

```python
POST https://my_website.com/webhook_endpoint

user-agent: OpenAI/1.0 (+https://platform.openai.com/docs/webhooks)

content-type: application/json

webhook-id: wh_685342e6c53c8190a1be43f081506c52 # unique id for idempotency

webhook-timestamp: 1750287078 # timestamp of delivery attempt

webhook-signature: v1,K5oZfzN95Z9UVu1EsfQmfVNQhnkZ2pj9o9NDN/H/pI4= # signature to verify authenticity from OpenAI



{

  "object": "event",

  "id": "evt_685343a1381c819085d44c354e1b330e",

  "type": "realtime.call.incoming",

  "created_at": 1750287018, // Unix timestamp

  "data": {

    "call_id": "some_unique_id",

    "sip_headers": [

      { "name": "From", "value": "sip:+142555512112@sip.example.com" },

      { "name": "To", "value": "sip:+18005551212@sip.example.com" },

      { "name": "Call-ID", "value": "03782086-4ce9-44bf-8b0d-4e303d2cc590"}

    ]

  }

}
```

From this webhook, you can accept or reject the call, using the `call_id` value from the webhook.
When accepting the call, you'll provide the needed configuration
(instructions, voice, etc) for the Realtime API session.
Once established, you can set up a WebSocket and monitor the session as usual. The APIs to
accept, reject, monitor, refer, and hangup the call are documented below.

## Accept the call

Use the [Accept call endpoint](/docs/api-reference/realtime-calls/accept-call) to
approve the inbound call and configure the realtime session that will answer it.
Send the same parameters you would send in a
[`create client secret`](/docs/api-reference/realtime-sessions/create-realtime-client-secret)
request, i.e., ensure the realtime model, voice, tools, or instructions are set before bridging the
call to the model.

```bash
curl -X POST
"https://api.openai.com/v1/realtime/calls/
$CALL_ID
/accept"
 \

  -H
"Authorization: Bearer
$OPENAI_API_KEY
"
 \

  -H
"Content-Type: application/json"
 \

  -d
'{

        "type": "realtime",

        "model": "gpt-realtime",

        "instructions": "You are Alex, a friendly concierge for Example Corp."

      }'
```

The request path must include the `call_id` from the
[`realtime.call.incoming`](/docs/api-reference/webhook-events/realtime/call/incoming)
webhook, and every request requires the `Authorization` header shown above. The
endpoint returns `200 OK` once the SIP leg is ringing and the realtime session
is being established.

## Reject the call

Use the [Reject call endpoint](/docs/api-reference/realtime-calls/reject-call) to
decline an invite when you do not want to handle the incoming call, (e.g., from
an unsupported country code.) Supply the `call_id` path parameter
and an optional SIP `status_code` (e.g., `486` to indicate "busy") in the JSON
body to control the response sent back to the carrier.

```json
curl -X POST
"https://api.openai.com/v1/realtime/calls/
$CALL_ID
/reject"
 \

  -H
"Authorization: Bearer
$OPENAI_API_KEY
"
 \

  -H
"Content-Type: application/json"
 \

  -d
'{"status_code": 486}'
```

If no status code is supplied the API uses `603 Decline` by default. A
successful request responds with `200 OK` after OpenAI delivers the SIP
response.

## Monitor call events

After you accept a call, open a WebSocket connection to the same session to
stream events and issue realtime commands. Note that when connecting to an existing
call using the `call_id` parameter, the `model` argument is not used (as it has already been configured
via the `accept` endpoint).

### WebSocket request

`GET wss://api.openai.com/v1/realtime?call_id={call_id}`

### Query parameters

| Parameter | Type | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `call_id` | string | Identifier from the `realtime.call.incoming` webhook. |

### Headers

* `Authorization: Bearer YOUR_API_KEY`

The WebSocket behaves exactly like any other Realtime API connection. Send
[`response.create`](/docs/api-reference/realtime_client_events/response/create),
and other client events to control the call, and listen for server events to
track progress. See [Webhooks and server-side controls](/docs/guides/realtime-server-controls)
for more information.

```
import
 WebSocket
from

"ws"
;



const
 callId =
"rtc_u1_9c6574da8b8a41a18da9308f4ad974ce"
;

const
 ws =
new
 WebSocket(
`wss://api.openai.com/v1/realtime?call_id=
${callId}
`
, {


headers
: {


Authorization
:
`Bearer
${process.env.OPENAI_API_KEY}
`
,

    },

});



ws.on(
"open"
,
() =>
 {

    ws.send(


JSON
.stringify({


type
:
"response.create"
,

        })

    );

});
```

## Redirect the call

Transfer an active call using the
[Refer call endpoint](/docs/api-reference/realtime-calls/refer-call). Provide the
`call_id` as well as the `target_uri` that should be placed in the SIP `Refer-To`
header (for example `tel:+14155550123` or `sip:agent@example.com`).

```bash
curl -X POST
"https://api.openai.com/v1/realtime/calls/
$CALL_ID
/refer"
 \

  -H
"Authorization: Bearer
$OPENAI_API_KEY
"
 \

  -H
"Content-Type: application/json"
 \

  -d
'{"target_uri": "tel:+14155550123"}'
```

OpenAI returns `200 OK` once the REFER is relayed to your SIP provider. The
downstream system handles the rest of the call flow for the caller.

## Hang up the call

End the session with the [Hang up endpoint](/docs/api-reference/realtime-calls/hangup-call)
when your application should disconnect the caller. This endpoint can be used to
terminate both SIP and WebRTC realtime sessions.

```bash
curl -X POST
"https://api.openai.com/v1/realtime/calls/
$CALL_ID
/hangup"
 \

  -H
"Authorization: Bearer
$OPENAI_API_KEY
"
```

The API responds with `200 OK` when it starts tearing down the call.

## Python example

The following is an example of a `realtime.call.incoming` handler. It accepts the call and then logs all the events from
the Realtime API.
