# Using realtime models

Use realtime models and prompting effectively.

Realtime models are post-trained for specific customer use cases. In response to your feedback, the latest speech-to-speech model works differently from previous models. Use this guide to understand and get the most out of it.

## Meet the models

Our most advanced speech-to-speech model is [gpt-realtime](/docs/models/gpt-realtime).

This model shows improvements in following complex instructions, calling tools, and producing speech that sounds natural and expressive. For more information, see the [announcement blog post](https://openai.com/index/introducing-gpt-realtime/).

## Update your session to use a prompt

After you initiate a session over [WebRTC](/docs/guides/realtime-webrtc), [WebSocket](/docs/guides/realtime-websocket), or [SIP](/docs/guides/realtime-sip), the client and model are connected. The server will send a [session.created](/docs/api-reference/realtime-server-events/session/created) event to confirm. Now it's a matter of prompting.

### Basic prompt update

1. Create a basic audio prompt in [the dashboard](/audio/realtime).

   If you don't know where to start, experiment with the prompt fields until you find something interesting. You can always manage, iterate on, and version your prompts later.
2. Update your realtime session to use the prompt you created. Provide its prompt ID in a `session.update` client event:

Update the system instructions used by the model in this session

javascript

```javascript
const
 event = {


type
:
"session.update"
,


session
: {


type
:
"realtime"
,


model
:
"gpt-realtime"
,


// Lock the output to audio (set to ["text"] if you want text without audio)



output_modalities
: [
"audio"
],


audio
: {


input
: {


format
: {


type
:
"audio/pcm"
,


rate
:
,

          },


turn_detection
: {


type
:
"semantic_vad"


          }

        },


output
: {


format
: {


type
:
"audio/pcm"
,

          },


voice
:
"marin"
,

        }

      },


// Use a server-stored prompt by ID. Optionally pin a version and pass variables.



prompt
: {


id
:
"pmpt_123"
,
// your stored prompt ID



version
:
"89"
,
// optional: pin a specific version



variables
: {


city
:
"Paris"

// example variable used by your prompt


        }

      },


// You can still set direct session fields; these override prompt fields if they overlap:



instructions
:
"Speak clearly and briefly. Confirm understanding before taking actions."


  },

};



// WebRTC data channel and WebSocket both have .send()


dataChannel.send(
JSON
.stringify(event));
```

```javascript
event = {


"type"
:
"session.update"
,

    session: {


type
:
"realtime"
,

      model:
"gpt-realtime"
,


# Lock the output to audio (add "text" if you also want text)


      output_modalities: [
"audio"
],

      audio: {


input
: {


format
: {


type
:
"audio/pcm"
,

            rate:
,

          },

          turn_detection: {


type
:
"semantic_vad"


          }

        },

        output: {


format
: {


type
:
"audio/pcmu"
,

          },

          voice:
"marin"
,

        }

      },


# Use a server-stored prompt by ID. Optionally pin a version and pass variables.


      prompt: {


id
:
"pmpt_123"
,          // your stored prompt ID

        version:
"89"
,           // optional: pin a specific version

        variables: {

          city:
"Paris"
          // example variable used by your prompt

        }

      },


# You can still set direct session fields; these override prompt fields if they overlap:


      instructions:
"Speak clearly and briefly. Confirm understanding before taking actions."


    }

}

ws.send(json.dumps(event))
```

When the session's updated, the server emits a [session.updated](/docs/api-reference/realtime-server-events/session/updated) event with the new state of the session. You can update the session any time.

### Changing prompt mid-call

To update the session mid-call (to swap prompt version or variables, or override instructions), send the update over the same data channel you're using:

```
// Example: switch to a specific prompt version and change a variable


dc.send(
JSON
.stringify({


type
:
"session.update"
,


session
: {


type
:
"realtime"
,


prompt
: {


id
:
"pmpt_123"
,


version
:
"89"
,


variables
: {


city
:
"Berlin"


      }

    }

  }

}));



// Example: override instructions (note: direct session fields take precedence over Prompt fields)


dc.send(
JSON
.stringify({


type
:
"session.update"
,


session
: {


type
:
"realtime"
,


instructions
:
"Speak faster and keep answers under two sentences."


  }

}));
```

## Prompting gpt-realtime

Here are top tips for prompting the realtime speech-to-speech model. For a more in-depth guide to prompting, see the [realtime prompting cookbook](https://cookbook.openai.com/examples/realtime_prompting_guide).

### General usage tips

* **Iterate relentlessly**. Small wording changes can make or break behavior.

  Example: Swapping “inaudible” → “unintelligible” improved noisy input handling.
* **Use bullets over paragraphs**. Clear, short bullets outperform long paragraphs.
* **Guide with examples**. The model strongly follows onto sample phrases.
* **Be precise**. Ambiguity and conflicting instructions degrade performance, similar to GPT-5.
* **Control language**. Pin output to a target language if you see drift.
* **Reduce repetition**. Add a variety rule to reduce robotic phrasing.
* **Use all caps for emphasis**: Capitalize key rules to makes them stand out to the model.
* **Convert non-text rules to text**: The model responds better to clearly written text.

  Example: Instead of writing, "IF x > 3 THEN ESCALATE", write, "IF MORE THAN THREE FAILURES THEN ESCALATE."

### Structure your prompt

Organize your prompt to help the model understand context and stay consistent across turns.

Use clear, labeled sections in your system prompt so the model can find and follow them. Keep each section focused on one thing.

```
# Role & Objective        — who you are and what “success” means


# Personality & Tone      — the voice and style to maintain


# Context                 — retrieved context, relevant info


# Reference Pronunciations — phonetic guides for tricky words


# Tools                   — names, usage rules, and preambles


# Instructions / Rules    — do’s, don’ts, and approach


# Conversation Flow       — states, goals, and transitions


# Safety & Escalation     — fallback and handoff logic
```

This format also makes it easier for you to iterate and modify problematic sections.

To make this system prompt your own, add domain-specific sections (e.g., Compliance, Brand Policy) and remove sections you don’t need. In each section, provide instructions and other information for the model to respond correctly. See specifics below.

## Practical tips for prompting realtime models

Here are 10 tips for creating effective, consistently performing prompts with gpt-realtime. These are just an overview. For more details and full system prompt examples, see the [realtime prompting cookbook](https://cookbook.openai.com/examples/realtime_prompting_guide).

#### 1. Be precise. Kill conflicts.

The new realtime model is very good at instruction following. However, that also means small wording changes or unclear instructions can shift behavior in meaningful ways. Inspect and iterate on your system prompt to try different phrasing and fix instruction contradictions.

In one experiment we ran, changing the word "inaudible" to "unintelligble" in instructions for handling noisy inputs significantly improved the model's performance.

After your first attempt at a system prompt, have an LLM review it for ambiguity or conflicts.

#### 2. Bullets > paragraphs.

Realtime models follow short bullet points better than long paragraphs.

Before (harder to follow):

```
When
 you can’t clearly hear the
user
, don’t proceed. If there’s background noise
or
 you
only
 caught part
of
 the sentence, pause
and
 ask them politely
to
 repeat themselves
in
 their preferred
language
,
and
 make sure you keep the conversation
in
 the same
language

as
 the user.
```

After (easier to follow):

```
Only
 respond
to
 clear audio
or
 text.



If audio
is
 unclear
/
partial
/
noisy
/
silent, ask
for
 clarification
in
 `{preferred_language}`.



Continue
in
 the same
language

as
 the
user
 if intelligible.
```

#### 3. Handle unclear audio.

The realtime model is good at following instructions on how to handle unclear audio. Spell out what to do when audio isn’t usable.

```go
## Unclear audio

-
 Always respond
in
 the same
language
 the
user

is
 speaking
in
, if intelligible.

-

Default

to
 English if the input
language

is
 unclear.

-

Only
 respond
to
 clear audio
or
 text.

-
 If the
user
's audio is not clear (e.g., ambiguous input/background noise/silent/unintelligible) or if you did not fully hear or understand the user, ask for clarification using {preferred_language} phrases.



Sample clarification phrases (parameterize with {preferred_language}):



- “Sorry, I didn’t catch that—could you say it again?”

- “There’s some background noise. Please repeat the last part.”

- “I only heard part of that. What did you say after ___?”
```

#### 4. Constrain the model to one language.

If you see the model switching languages in an unhelpful way, add a dedicated "Language" section in your prompt. Make sure it doesn’t conflict with other rules. By default, mirroring the user’s language works well.

Here's a simple way to mirror the user's language:

```go
##
Language


Language
 matching: Respond
in
 the same
language

as
 the
user
 unless directed otherwise.

For
 non
-
English,
start

with
 the same standard accent
/
dialect the
user
 uses.
```

Here's an example of an English-only constraint:

```
##
Language


-
 The conversation will be
only

in
 English.

-
 Do
not
 respond
in

any
 other
language
, even if the
user
 asks.

-
 If the
user
 speaks another
language
, politely explain that support
is
 limited
to
 English.
```

In a language teaching application, your language and conversation sections might look like this:

```
#
# Language


#
## Explanations


Use English when explaining grammar, vocabulary, or cultural context.



#
## Conversation


Speak in French when conducting practice, giving examples, or engaging in dialogue.
```

You can also control dialect for a more consistent personality:

```
#
# Language


Response only in argentine spanish.
```

#### 5. Provide sample phrases and flow snippets.

The model learns style from examples. Give short, varied samples for common conversation moments.

For example, you might give this high-level shape of conversation flow to the model:

```
Greeting → Discover → Verify → Diagnose → Resolve → Confirm
/
Close. Advance
only

when
 criteria
in

each
 phase
are
 met.
```

And then provide prompt guidance for each section. For example, here's how you might instruct for the greeting section:

```
## Conversation flow — Greeting


Goal:
Set
 tone
and
 invite the reason
for
 calling.



How to respond:

- Identify
as
 ACME Internet Support.

- Keep it brief; invite the caller’s goal.



Sample phrases (vary, don’t always reuse):

- “Thanks
for
 calling ACME Internet—how can I
help
 today?”

- “You’ve reached ACME Support. What’s going on
with
 your service?”

- “Hi there—tell me what you’d like
help

with
.”



Exit when: Caller states an initial goal
or
 symptom.
```

#### 6. Avoid robotic repetition.

If responses sound repetitive or robotic, include an explicit variety instruction. This can sometimes happen when using sample phrases.

```
#
# Variety


- Do not repeat the same sentence twice. Vary your responses so it doesn't sound robotic.
```

#### 7. Use capitalized text to emphasize instructions.

Like many LLMs, using capitalization for important rules can help the model to understand and follow those rules. It's also helpful to convert non-text rules (such as numerical conditions) into text before capitalization.

Instead of:

```
## Rules

- If [func.return_value] >
, respond
 to the user.
```

Use:

```
## Rules

- IF [func.return_value] IS BIGGER THAN
, RESPOND
 TO THE USER.
```

#### 8. Help the model use tools.

The model's use of tools can alter the experience—how much they rely on user confirmation vs. taking action, what they say while they make the tool call, which rules they follow for each specific tool, etc.

One way to prompt for tool usage is to use preambles. Good preambles instruct the model to give the user some feedback about what it's doing before it makes the tool call, so the user always knows what's going on.

Here's an example:

```go
# Tools

-
 Before
any
 tool
call
, say
one
 short line
like
 “I’m checking that now.”
Then

call
 the tool immediately.
```

You can include sample phrases for preambles to add variety and better tailor to your use case.

There are several other ways to improve the model's behavior when performing tool calls and keeping the conversation going with the user. Ideally, the model is calling the right tools proactively, checking for confirmation for any important write actions, and keeping the user informed along the way. For more specifics, see the [realtime prompting cookbook](https://cookbook.openai.com/examples/realtime_prompting_guide).

#### 9. Use LLMs to improve your prompt.

LLMs are great at finding what's going wrong in your prompt. Use ChatGPT or the API to get a model's review of your current realtime prompt and get help improving it.

Whether your prompt is working well or not, here's a prompt you can run to get a model's review:

```go
## Role & Objective


You are a **Prompt-Critique Expert**.

Examine a user-supplied LLM prompt
and
 surface
any
 weaknesses following the instructions below.



## Instructions


Review the prompt that
is
 meant
for
 an LLM to follow
and
 identify the following issues:

- Ambiguity: Could
any
 wording be interpreted
in
 more than one way?

- Lacking Definitions: Are there
any

class

labels
,
terms
,
or

concepts

that

are

not

defined

that

might

be

misinterpreted

by

an

LLM
?

-
Conflicting
,
missing
,
or

vague

instructions
:
 Are directions incomplete
or
 contradictory?

- Unstated assumptions: Does the prompt assume the model has to be able to do something that
is

not
 explicitly stated?



## Do **NOT** list issues of the following types:


- Invent new instructions, tool calls,
or
 external information. You do
not
 know what tools need to be added that are missing.

- Issues that you are
not
 sure about.



## Output Format




# Issues


- Numbered
list
; include brief quote snippets.



# Improvements


- Numbered
list
; provide the revised lines you would change
and
 how you would changed them.



# Revised Prompt


- Revised prompt where you have applied
all
 your improvements surgically
with
 minimal edits to the original prompt
```

Use this template as a starting point for troubleshooting a recurring issue:

```go
Here's my current prompt to an LLM:

[BEGIN OF CURRENT PROMPT]

{CURRENT_PROMPT}

[END OF CURRENT PROMPT]



But I see this issue happening from the LLM:

[BEGIN OF ISSUE]

{ISSUE}

[END OF ISSUE]

Can you provide some variants of the prompt so that the model can better understand the constraints to alleviate the issue?
```

#### 10. Help users resolve issues faster.

Two frustrating user experiences are slow, mechanical voice agents and the inability to escalate. Help users faster by providing instructions in your system prompt for speed and escalation.

In the personality and tone section of your system prompt, add pacing instructions to get the model to quicken its support:

```
#
 Personality & Tone


#
# Personality


Friendly, calm and approachable expert customer service assistant.



#
# Tone


Tone: Warm, concise, confident, never fawning.



#
# Length


2–3 sentences per turn.



#
# Pacing


Deliver your audio response fast, but do not sound rushed. Do not modify the content of your response, only increase speaking speed for the same response.
```

Often with realtime voice agents, having a reliable way to escalate to a human is important. In a safety and escalation section, modify the instructions on WHEN to escalate depending on your use case. Here's an example:

```
# Safety
&
 Escalation

When

to
 escalate (
no
 extra troubleshooting):

-
 Safety risk (self
-
harm, threats, harassment)

-

User
 explicitly asks
for
 a human

-
 Severe dissatisfaction (e.g., “extremely frustrated,” repeated complaints, profanity)

-

*
*
*
*
 failed tool attempts
on
 the same task
*
*
or
*
*

*
*
*
*
 consecutive
no
-
match
/
no
-
input events

-

Out
-
of
-
scope

or
 restricted (e.g.,
real
-
time
 news, financial
/
legal
/
medical advice)



What
to
 say
at
 the same
time

of
 calling the escalate_to_human tool (MANDATORY):

-
 “Thanks
for
 your patience—
*
*
I’m connecting you
with
 a specialist now
*
*
.”

-

Then

call
 the tool: `escalate_to_human`



Examples that would require escalation:

-
 “This
is
 the third
time
 the reset didn’t work. Just
get
 me a person.”

-
 “I am extremely frustrated
!
”
```
