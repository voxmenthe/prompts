# Code generation

Learn how to use OpenAI Codex models to generate code.

Writing, reviewing, editing, and answering questions about code is one of the primary use cases for OpenAI models today. This guide walks through your options for code generation.

**Codex** is OpenAI's series of AI coding tools that help developers move faster by delegating tasks to powerful cloud and local coding agents. Interact with Codex in a variety of interfaces: in your IDE, through the CLI, on web and mobile sites, or in your CI/CD pipelines with the SDK. Codex is the best way to get agentic software engineering on your projects.

**Codex models** are LLMs specifically trained at coding tasks. They power Codex, and you can use them to create coding-specific applications. For example, let your *end users* generate code.

Use Codex for out-of-the-box coding agents

Connect your codebase Codex and accelerate your projects using software engineering agents.](#use-codex)[![Integrate with coding models](https://cdn.openai.com/API/docs/images/build.png)

Integrate with coding models

Use OpenAI models in your application. Add them to a model picker, for instance.](#integrate-with-coding-models)

## Use Codex

Codex has an interface in the browser, similar to ChatGPT, where you can kick off coding tasks that run in the cloud. Visit [chatgpt.com/codex](https://chatgpt.com/codex) to use it.

Codex also has an IDE extension, CLI, and SDK to help you create coding tasks in whichever environment makes the most sense for you. For example, the SDK is useful for using Codex in CI/CD pipelines. The CLI, on the other hand, runs locally from your terminal and can read, modify, and run code on your machine.

See the [Codex docs](https://developers.openai.com/codex) for quickstarts, reference, pricing, and more information.

## Integrate with coding models

OpenAI has several models trained specifically to work with code. GPT-5.1-Codex-Max is our best agentic coding model. That said, many OpenAI models excel at writing and editing code as well as other tasks. Use a Codex model if you *only* want it for coding-related work.

Here's an example that calls GPT-5.1-Codex-Max, the model that powers Codex:

Slower, high reasoning tasks

python

```python
import
 OpenAI
from

"openai"
;

const
 openai =
new
 OpenAI();



const
 result =
await
 openai.responses.create({


model
:
"gpt-5.1-codex-max"
,


input
:
"Find the null pointer exception: ...your code here..."
,


reasoning
: {
effort
:
"high"
 },

});



console
.log(result.output_text);
```

```python
from
 openai
import
 OpenAI

client = OpenAI()



result = client.responses.create(

    model=
"gpt-5.1-codex-max"
,


input
=
"Find the null pointer exception: ...your code here..."
,

    reasoning={
"effort"
:
"high"
 },

)



print
(result.output_text)
```

```python
curl https://api.openai.com/v1/responses \

  -H
"Content-Type: application/json"
 \

  -H
"Authorization: Bearer
$OPENAI_API_KEY
"
 \

  -d
'{

    "model": "gpt-5.1-codex-max",

    "input": "Find the null pointer exception: ...your code here...",

    "reasoning": { "effort": "high" }

  }'
```
