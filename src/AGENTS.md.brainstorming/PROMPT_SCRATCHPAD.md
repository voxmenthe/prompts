We'd like to incorporate these instructions: PLANS/logical-thinking.md into this set of prompts for an AI agentic coding assistant: .codex/AGENTS.md so as to improve performance

What we're trying to achieve is a deep integration of the content from PLANS/logical-thinking.md by adding in the key components from that doc into exactly the right places in .codex/AGENTS.md

This should feel like a more organic melding of the two documents, instead of just bolt-ons.

We have a tentative integration plan here: PLANS/agents-logical-integration-plan.md
Option E comes closest to our goals but is less than ideal. 
Either improve Option E or come up with a better plan (Option F) and edit the plan document
