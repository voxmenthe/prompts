EXAMPLE:
Prompt: 

Use the best practices provided below and the intial context I shared to create a deep research prompt on the following topic:

Context: 
I am an investor who wants to better understand how durable DoorDash’s business is. My hypothesis is that they have a three sided network between drivers and riders and restaurants that would be incredibly hard to replicate. Additionally, they built it when interest rates were low so it would be hard to create a competitor today. I need you to make sure you deeply research a few things, at least, though you will find more things that are important - 
- doordash’s business model  
-  how takeout is a part of the restaurant business model, and the relationship restaurants have with delivery networks. Advantages, risks, etc  
- the trend of food away from home consumption in America, how it has changed in the last decade and where it might go 
- Doordash’s competitors and the history of their competitive space   

I need the final report to be as comprehensive and thorough as possible. It should be soundly rooted in business strategy, academic research, and data-driven. But it also needs to use industry blogs and other sources, too. Even reviews are ok.

EXAMPLE OUTPUT PROMPT:
Deep Research Prompt on DoorDash’s Business Durability
1.  Objective:
Provide a comprehensive, data-driven report evaluating the long-term durability of DoorDash’s business model. The central hypothesis is that DoorDash’s three-sided network—connecting drivers, diners, and restaurants—creates a competitive advantage that is difficult to replicate, especially given it was built during a low-interest-rate period. This report should leverage both quantitative and qualitative sources to determine the resilience and growth potential of DoorDash’s model in the face of changing economic and market conditions.
2. Provide Adequate Context and Background

Context: 
DoorDash is a leader in on-demand food delivery, connecting consumers with restaurants and drivers via a digital platform.
The business thrives on network effects: the more restaurants and drivers it has, the more appealing it becomes to consumers, and vice versa.
The company scaled aggressively during a period of low interest rates, raising capital more cheaply than might be possible today.

Background:
Takeout and delivery are increasingly integral to restaurant operations; however, high commission fees and reliance on third-party platforms bring potential risks and benefits to restaurants.
U.S. consumers have steadily increased food-away-from-home spending, but emerging trends—like “ghost kitchens” and shifting consumer preferences—could reshape the landscape.
DoorDash faces competition from companies like Uber Eats, Grubhub, and emerging players, each with varying strategies and market shares.

3. Use Specific and Unambiguous Language
Key Terms & Clarifications
- Three-Sided Network: A platform connecting three distinct user groups—drivers, diners, and restaurants.
- Network Effects: The increased value of a service as more people use it.
- Durability: The ability of DoorDash’s business model to maintain market leadership and profitability over the long term.

4. Detail Step-by-Step Instructions
Business Model Analysis
- Describe DoorDash’s revenue streams, unit economics, and how its three-sided platform operates.
- Discuss how the low-interest-rate environment influenced its growth, fundraising, and capital expenditures.

Restaurant Takeout Dynamics
- Investigate the role of takeout in a restaurant’s overall business model.
- Analyze advantages (e.g., expanded customer reach, off-premise revenue) and risks (e.g., high commission fees, reliance on third-party platforms) for restaurant partners.

Market Trends: 
- Food Away From Home: Present historical data (covering at least the last decade) on how Americans are shifting spending patterns from in-home cooking to food-away-from-home options.
- Forecast potential changes in consumer behavior (e.g., after COVID-19, economic downturns, or technological shifts).

Competitive Landscape
- Examine DoorDash’s major competitors, their historical evolution, and strategic pivots (e.g., Uber Eats’ global reach, Grubhub’s early market presence).
- Evaluate each competitor’s strengths and weaknesses relative to DoorDash.

Additional Factors
- Identify any other relevant influences, such as new legal regulations (e.g., caps on delivery commissions), consumer sentiment about gig work, or macroeconomic shifts.

Critical Analysis & Recommendations
- Apply at least three established business strategy framework (e.g., Porter’s Five Forces, SWOT) to synthesize findings.
- Propose an overall evaluation of DoorDash’s market durability and key strategic recommendations (e.g., product diversification, partnerships, or geographic expansion).

5. Guide the Desired Output Format
Structure Your Report With Clear Headings:
Introduction & Executive Summary
DoorDash Business Model Analysis
Restaurant Takeout & Delivery Network Dynamics
Food-Away-From-Home Trends
Competitive Landscape
Synthesis: Strategic Framework Application
Conclusion & Recommendations
References & Sources

Include Data Visualizations:
Where possible, embed charts or tables to illustrate market share, historical growth, or consumer behavior changes.

6. Balance Detail with Flexibility
While this outline provides clear research directions, remain open to exploring additional subtopics or emerging angles that become apparent during your investigation. For instance, you might delve deeper into specific technological innovations (e.g., AI-driven route optimization) if they significantly impact DoorDash’s durability.

7. Incorporate Iterative Refinement
Draft, Review, Refine:
- Draft the report based on the step-by-step instructions.
- Review for any gaps or ambiguities.
- Refine by adding any missing context, improving clarity, and ensuring logical flow.

8. Use Proven Techniques (Chain-of-Thought Prompting)

Reasoning Approach:
- Clearly show intermediate reasoning steps in each section. For example, when discussing competition, explain the logical process used to rank or evaluate different companies.

9. Employ Role Prompting
Role: Act as a seasoned financial and business strategy analyst. Provide authoritative, well-reasoned insights aimed at informing an investor’s perspective on DoorDash’s long-term prospects.

10. Demand Justification and Source References

Evidence & Citations:
Support every major claim or data point with references (e.g., “according to [industry report]” or “as found in [peer-reviewed study]”).
Incorporate insights from academic journals, business strategy publications, industry blogs, and even user reviews where relevant.

11. Review and Edit Thoroughly
Final Quality Check:
Before submitting the final report, proofread for logical flow, completeness, and correctness of data citations.
Ensure your conclusions and recommendations directly tie back to your hypothesis regarding DoorDash’s durable competitive advantage.
