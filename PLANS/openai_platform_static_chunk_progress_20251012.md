# OpenAI Platform Static Chunk Mirroring – Progress Update (October 12, 2025)

## Work Completed in This Iteration
- Implemented module graph analysis primitives (`ModuleInfo`, `ImportBinding`, `ReExportBinding`, `ResolvedSymbol`) to capture literal/function exports, aliasing, and star re‑exports across Vite chunks.
- Added comprehensive import/export parsers and path normalization so chunk-relative specifiers resolve to canonical `static/...` assets.
- Reworked `mirror_platform_guides` pipeline to:
  - Preload the root docs chunk and its dependencies once per run.
  - Recursively resolve constant/function identifiers across aliased imports and re-exports.
  - Inject alias bridge declarations for functions and reuse resolved literals to shrink ad-hoc stubs.
- Preserved the existing evaluation pipeline (QuickJS render → HTML → Markdown) while reducing failure cases tied to unresolved symbols.

## Current Status
- Script now resolves many previously missing identifiers (e.g., `Go`, `Fa`, `$l`) when definitions exist in other static bundles.
- Evaluation is still contingent on strong heuristics for CSS/analytics helpers; unresolved names fall back to `{}` stubs.
- Full `--subset guides` dry run has not yet been executed post-changes, so coverage improvements are unverified.

## Outstanding Work to Reach Fully Working State
1. **Analytics/Telemetry Fallbacks**  
   - Provide explicit no-op definitions for persistent globals that are intentionally external (e.g., analytics trackers) and ensure structured logging when the fallback is exercised.
2. **Identifier Candidate Refinement**  
   - Expand/adjust `collect_property_identifier_candidates` to include remaining CSS module maps without capturing prose tokens; add regression tests for tricky guides (e.g., nested tables, deep component trees).
3. **Unit & Snapshot Tests**  
   - Introduce representative table-driven tests covering: simple guide, alias-heavy guide, analytics-dependent guide, and CSS module heavy guide.  
   - Validate QuickJS evaluation outputs against checked-in Markdown fixtures.
4. **Full Dry Run & Diff Audit**  
   - Execute `uv run ... --subset guides` end-to-end, capture manifest deltas, and spot-check high-signal guides (ChatGPT Retrieval, Prompt Engineering, Deep Research).  
   - Document remaining failures with root-cause notes or follow-up tasks.
5. **Observability Enhancements**  
   - Emit structured log entries for alias resolution misses (module, symbol, attempted path) to accelerate debugging of future regressions.

## Next Immediate Step
- Implement targeted no-op stubs plus logging for unresolved analytics helpers, then re-test resolver coverage on a sample of previously failing guides.
