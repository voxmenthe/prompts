# Agents playground

> A virtual workbench to test your multimodal AI agent.

## Overview

The LiveKit Agents playground is a versatile web frontend that makes it easy to test your multimodal AI agent without having to worry about UI until you're happy with your AI.

To use the playground, you first need to have an agent running in `dev` or `start` mode. If you haven't done that yet, first follow the [Voice AI quickstart](https://docs.livekit.io/agents/start/voice-ai.md).

| Feature | Notes |
| Audio | Mic input and speaker output with visualizer |
| Text | Live transcription and chat input |
| Video | Live webcam input, live output |
