# Spitch STT integration guide

> How to use the Spitch STT plugin for LiveKit Agents.

## Overview

[Spitch](https://spitch.app/) provides AI-powered speech and language solutions optimized for African languages. With LiveKit's Spitch STT integration and the Agents framework, you can build voice AI agents that understand speech in a variety of African languages.

## Quick reference

This section provides a quick reference for the Spitch STT plugin. For more information, see [Additional resources](#additional-resources).

### Installation

Install the plugin from PyPI:

```bash
pip install "livekit-agents[spitch]~=1.2"

```

### Authentication

The Spitch plugin requires a [Spitch API key](https://studio.spitch.app/api/keys).

Set `SPITCH_API_KEY` in your `.env` file.

### Usage

Use Spitch STT in an `AgentSession` or as a standalone transcription service. For example, you can use this STT in the [Voice AI quickstart](https://docs.livekit.io/agents/start/voice-ai.md).

```python
from livekit.plugins import spitch

session = AgentSession(
   stt=spitch.STT(
      language="en",
   ),
   # ... llm, tts, etc.
)

```

### Parameters

This section describes some of the available parameters. See the [plugin reference](https://docs.livekit.io/reference/python/v1/livekit/plugins/spitch/index.html.md#livekit.plugins.spitch.STT) for a complete list of all available parameters.

- **`language`** _(string)_ (optional) - Default: `en`: Language short code of the input speech. For supported values, see [Spitch languages](https://docs.spitch.app/concepts/languages).
