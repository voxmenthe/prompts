# Amazon Polly TTS integration guide

> How to use the Amazon Polly TTS plugin for LiveKit Agents.

## Overview

[Amazon Polly](https://aws.amazon.com/polly/) is an AI voice generator that provides high-quality, natural-sounding human voices in multiple languages. With LiveKit's Amazon Polly integration and the Agents framework, you can build voice AI applications that sound realistic.

## Quick reference

This section includes a basic usage example and some reference material. For links to more detailed documentation, see [Additional resources](#additional-resources).

### Installation

Install the plugin from PyPI:

```bash
pip install "livekit-agents[aws]~=1.2"

```

### Authentication

The Amazon Polly plugin requires an [AWS API key](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/general/latest/gr/aws-sec-cred-types.html).

Set the following environment variables in your `.env` file:

```shell
AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID=<aws-access-key-id>
AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY=<aws-secret-access-key>
AWS_DEFAULT_REGION=<aws-deployment-region>

```

### Usage

Use an Amazon Polly TTS within an `AgentSession` or as a standalone speech generator. For example, you can use this TTS in the [Voice AI quickstart](https://docs.livekit.io/agents/start/voice-ai.md).

```python
from livekit.plugins import aws

session = AgentSession(
   tts=aws.TTS(
      voice="Ruth",
      speech_engine="generative",
      language="en-US",
   ),
   # ... llm, stt, etc.
)

```

### Parameters

This section describes some of the parameters. See the [plugin reference](https://docs.livekit.io/reference/python/v1/livekit/plugins/aws/tts.html.md) for a complete list of all available parameters.

- **`voice`** _(TTSModels)_ (optional) - Default: `Ruth`: Voice to use for the synthesis. For a full list, see [Available voices](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/polly/latest/dg/available-voices.html).

- **`language`** _(TTS_LANGUAGE | string)_ (optional): Language code for the Synthesize Speech request. This is only necessary if using a bilingual voice, such as Aditi, which can be used for either Indian English (en-IN) or Hindi (hi-IN). To learn more, see [Languages in Amazon Polly](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/polly/latest/dg/supported-languages.html).

- **`speech_engine`** _(TTS_SPEECH_ENGINE)_ (optional) - Default: `generative`: The voice engine to use for the synthesis. Valid values are `standard`, `neural`, `long-form`, and `generative`. To learn more, see [Amazon Polly voice engines](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/polly/latest/dg/voice-engines-polly.html).

## Controlling speech and pronunciation

Amazon Polly supports Speech Synthesis Markup Language (SSML) for customizing generated speech. To learn more, see [Generating speech from SSML docs](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/polly/latest/dg/ssml.html) and [Supported SSML tags](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/polly/latest/dg/supportedtags.html).
