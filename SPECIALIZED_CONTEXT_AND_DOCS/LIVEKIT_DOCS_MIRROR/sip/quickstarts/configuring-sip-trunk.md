# SIP trunk setup

> Guide to setting up SIP trunks for inbound and outbound calls with LiveKit.

## Overview

LiveKit is compatible with any SIP trunking provider. This guide provides general instructions for setting up a SIP trunk with an external provider and then associating it with your LiveKit Cloud project.

## External provider setup

The usual steps to create a SIP trunk are as follows:

1. Create a SIP trunk with your provider.
2. Add authentication or limit trunk usage by phone numbers or IP addresses.
3. Purchase a phone number and associate it with your SIP trunk.
4. Add your [LiveKit SIP endpoint](#sip-endpoint) to the SIP trunk.

### SIP endpoint

Depending on your SIP trunking provider, you might need to use a _SIP endpoint_ to configure inbound calls instead of your SIP URI. The SIP endpoint is your LiveKit SIP URI without the `sip:` prefix. You can find your SIP URI on the [**Project settings**](https://cloud.livekit.io/projects/p_/settings/project) page.

For example, if your SIP URI is `sip:vjnxecm0tjk.sip.livekit.cloud`, your SIP endpoint is `vjnxecm0tjk.sip.livekit.cloud`.

> ℹ️ **Region-based endpoints**
> 
> To restrict calls to a specific region, replace your global LiveKit SIP endpoint with a [region-based endpoint](https://docs.livekit.io/sip/cloud.md#region-pinning).

## Provider-specific instructions

- **[Telnyx Setup](https://docs.livekit.io/sip/quickstarts/configuring-telnyx-trunk.md)**: Step-by-step instructions for setting up a SIP trunk with Telnyx.

- **[Plivo Setup](https://docs.livekit.io/sip/quickstarts/configuring-plivo-trunk.md)**: Step-by-step instructions for setting up a SIP trunk with Plivo.

- **[Wavix Setup](https://docs.livekit.io/sip/quickstarts/configuring-wavix-trunk.md)**: Step-by-step instructions for setting up a SIP trunk with Wavix.

## LiveKit setup

Now you are ready to configure your LiveKit Cloud project to use the SIP trunk.

The following steps are common to all SIP trunking providers.

> ℹ️ **LiveKit CLI**
> 
> These examples use the [LiveKit Cloud](https://cloud.livekit.io/). For additional examples and full documentation, see the linked documentation for each component.

### Inbound trunk setup

An [inbound trunk](https://docs.livekit.io/sip/trunk-inbound.md) allows you to accept incoming phone calls.

Create an inbound trunk using the LiveKit Cloud dashboard.

1. Sign in to the **Telephony** → [**Configuration**](https://cloud.livekit.io/projects/p_/telephony/config) page.
2. Select **Create new** → **Trunk**.
3. Select the **JSON editor** tab.
4. Select **Inbound** for **Trunk direction**.
5. Copy and paste the following text into the editor, replacing the phone number with the number you purchased from your SIP trunk provider:

```json
{
  "name": "My inbound trunk",
  "numbers": ["+15105550123"]
}

```
6. Select **Create**.

### Create a dispatch rule

You must set up at least one [dispatch rule](https://docs.livekit.io/sip/dispatch-rule.md) to accept incoming calls into a LiveKit room.

This example creates a dispatch rule that puts each caller into a randomly generated unique room using the name prefix `call-`. For many applications, this is the only configuration you need.

1. Sign to the **Telephony** → [**Configuration**](https://cloud.livekit.io/projects/p_/telephony/config) page.
2. Select **Create new** → **Dispatch rule**.
3. Select the **JSON editor** tab.
4. Copy and paste the following text into the editor:

```json
{
   "name": "My dispatch rule",
   "rule": {
      "dispatchRuleIndividual": {
         "roomPrefix": "call-"
      }
   }
}

```
5. Select **Create**.

After you create an inbound trunk and dispatch rule, you can create an agent to answer incoming calls. To learn more, see the resources in the [Next steps](#next-steps) section.

### Create an outbound trunk

Create an [outbound trunk](https://docs.livekit.io/sip/trunk-outbound.md) to make outgoing phone calls with LiveKit.

This example creates an username and password authenticated outbound trunk with the phone number `+15105550123` and the trunk domain name `my-trunk-domain-name`.

1. Sign in to the **Telephony** → [**Configuration**](https://cloud.livekit.io/projects/p_/telephony/config) page.
2. Select **Create new** → **Trunk**.
3. Select the **JSON editor** tab.
4. Select **Outbound** for **Trunk direction**.
5. Copy and paste the following text into the editor:

```json
{
  "name": "My outbound trunk",
  "address": "<my-trunk-domain-name>",
  "numbers": [
    "+15105550123"
  ],
  "authUsername": "<username>",
  "authPassword": "<password>"
}

```
6. Select **Create**.

Now you are ready to [place outgoing calls](https://docs.livekit.io/sip/outbound-calls.md).
