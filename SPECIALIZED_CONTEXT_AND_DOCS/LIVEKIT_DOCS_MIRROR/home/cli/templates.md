# Bootstrapping an application

> Create and initialize an app from a convenient set of templates.

> ℹ️ **Note**
> 
> Before starting, make sure you have created a Cloud account, [installed the LiveKit CLI](https://docs.livekit.io/home/cli/cli-setup.md), and have authenticated or manually configured your LiveKit project of choice.

The LiveKit CLI can help you bootstrap applications from a number of convenient template repositories, using your project credentials to set up required environment variables and other configuration automatically. To create an application from a template, run the following:

```shell
lk app create --template <template_name> my-app

```

Then follow the CLI prompts to finish your setup.

The `--template` flag may be omitted to see a list of all available templates, or can be chosen from a selection of our first-party templates:
