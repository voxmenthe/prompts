`lk` is LiveKit's suite of CLI utilities. It lets you conveniently access server APIs, create tokens, and generate test traffic all from your command line. For more details, refer to the docs in the `livekit-cli` [GitHub repo](https://github.com/livekit/livekit-cli#usage).

## Authenticate with Cloud (optional)

For LiveKit Cloud users, you can authenticate the CLI with your Cloud project to create an API key and secret. This allows you to use the CLI without manually providing credentials each time.

```shell
lk cloud auth

```

Then, follow instructions and log in from a browser.

> 💡 **Tip**
> 
> If you're looking to explore LiveKit's [Agents](https://docs.livekit.io/agents.md) framework, or want to prototype your app against a prebuilt frontend or token server, check out [Sandboxes](https://docs.livekit.io/home/cloud/sandbox.md).

## Generate access token

A participant creating or joining a LiveKit [room](https://docs.livekit.io/home/concepts/api-primitives.md) needs an [access token](https://docs.livekit.io/home/concepts/authentication.md) to do so. For now, let’s generate one via CLI:

**Localhost**:

```shell
lk token create \
  --api-key devkey --api-secret secret \
  --join --room test_room --identity test_user \
  --valid-for 24h

```

> 💡 **Tip**
> 
> Make sure you're running LiveKit server locally in [dev mode](https://docs.livekit.io/home/self-hosting/local.md#dev-mode).

---

**Cloud**:

```shell
lk token create \
  --api-key <PROJECT_KEY> --api-secret <PROJECT_SECRET> \
  --join --room test_room --identity test_user \
  --valid-for 24h

```

Alternatively, you can [generate tokens from your project's dashboard](https://cloud.livekit.io/projects/p_/settings/keys).

## Test with LiveKit Meet

> 💡 **Tip**
> 
> If you're testing a LiveKit Cloud instance, you can find your `Project URL` (it starts with `wss://`) in the project settings.

Use a sample app, [LiveKit Meet](https://meet.livekit.io), to preview your new LiveKit instance. Enter the token you [previously generated](#generate-access-token) in the "Custom" tab. Once connected, your microphone and camera will be streamed in realtime to your new LiveKit instance (and any other participant who connects to the same room)!

If interested, here's the [full source](https://github.com/livekit-examples/meet) for this example app.

### Simulating another publisher

One way to test a multi-user session is by [generating](#generate-access-token) a second token (ensure `--identity` is unique), opening our example app in another [browser tab](https://meet.livekit.io) and connecting to the same room.

Another way is to use the CLI as a simulated participant and publish a prerecorded video to the room. Here's how:

**Localhost**:

```shell
lk room join \
  --url ws://localhost:7880 \
  --api-key devkey --api-secret secret \
  --publish-demo --identity bot_user \
  my_first_room

```

---

**Cloud**:

```shell
lk room join \
  --url <PROJECT_SECURE_WEBSOCKET_ADDRESS> \
  --api-key <PROJECT_API_KEY> --api-secret <PROJECT_SECRET_KEY> \
  --publish-demo --identity bot_user \
  my_first_room

```

This command publishes a looped demo video to `my-first-room`. Due to how the file was encoded, expect a short delay before your browser has sufficient data to render frames.
