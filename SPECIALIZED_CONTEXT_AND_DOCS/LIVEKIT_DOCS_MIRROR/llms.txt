# LiveKit Docs

> LiveKit is an open source platform for developers building realtime media applications. It makes it easy to integrate audio, video, text, data, and AI models while offering scalable realtime infrastructure built on top of WebRTC.

## Overview

LiveKit contains these primary components:

- [Open source WebRTC SFU](https://github.com/livekit/livekit), with a hosted global mesh version available as [LiveKit Cloud](https://cloud.livekit.io)
- [Open source AI Agents Framework](https://github.com/livekit/agents) for building realtime and Voice AI agents in Python (Node.js beta also [available](https://github.com/livekit/agents-js))
- [Realtime SDKs](https://docs.livekit.io/home/client/connect.md) to make it easy to add realitme audio, video, and data to your apps (available for Web, iOS, Android, Flutter, React Native, Unity, Python, Node.js, Rust, and more))
- [Telephony integration](https://docs.livekit.io/sip.md) built on SIP for integrating telephony into LiveKit rooms
