# `ReplicateStream`

ReplicateStream has been removed in AI SDK 4.0.

ReplicateStream is part of the legacy Replicate integration. It is not
compatible with the AI SDK 3.1 functions.

The ReplicateStream function is a utility that handles extracting the stream from the output of [Replicate](https://replicate.com)'s API. It expects a Prediction object as returned by the [Replicate JavaScript SDK](https://github.com/replicate/replicate-javascript), and returns a ReadableStream. Unlike other wrappers, ReplicateStream returns a Promise because it makes a fetch call to the [Replicate streaming API](https://github.com/replicate/replicate-javascript#streaming) under the hood.
