# `MistralStream`

MistralStream has been removed in AI SDK 4.0.

MistralStream is part of the legacy Mistral integration. It is not compatible
with the AI SDK 3.1 functions. It is recommended to use the [AI SDK Mistral
Provider](/providers/ai-sdk-providers/mistral) instead.

Transforms the output from Mistral's language models into a ReadableStream.

This works with the official Mistral API, and it's supported in both Node.js, the Edge Runtime, and browser environments.
