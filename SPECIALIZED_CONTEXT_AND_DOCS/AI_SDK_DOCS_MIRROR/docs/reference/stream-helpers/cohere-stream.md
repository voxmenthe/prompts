# `CohereStream`

CohereStream has been removed in AI SDK 4.0.

CohereStream is part of the legacy Cohere integration. It is not compatible
with the AI SDK 3.1 functions.

The CohereStream function is a utility that transforms the output from Cohere's API into a ReadableStream. It uses AIStream under the hood, applying a specific parser for the Cohere's response data structure. This works with the official Cohere API, and it's supported in both Node.js, the Edge Runtime, and browser environments.

## Import
