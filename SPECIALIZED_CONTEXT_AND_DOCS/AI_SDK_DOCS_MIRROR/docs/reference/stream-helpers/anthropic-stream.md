# `AnthropicStream`

AnthropicStream has been removed in AI SDK 4.0.

AnthropicStream is part of the legacy Anthropic integration. It is not
compatible with the AI SDK 3.1 functions. It is recommended to use the [AI SDK
Anthropic Provider](/providers/ai-sdk-providers/anthropic) instead.

It is a utility function that transforms the output from Anthropic's SDK into a ReadableStream. It uses AIStream under the hood, applying a specific parser for the Anthropic's response data structure.

## Import
