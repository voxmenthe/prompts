# `OpenAIStream`

OpenAIStream has been removed in AI SDK 4.0

OpenAIStream is part of the legacy OpenAI integration. It is not compatible
with the AI SDK 3.1 functions. It is recommended to use the [AI SDK OpenAI
Provider](/providers/ai-sdk-providers/openai) instead.

Transforms the response from OpenAI's language models into a ReadableStream.

Note: Prior to v4, the official OpenAI API SDK does not support the Edge Runtime and only works in serverless environments. The openai-edge package is based on fetch instead of axios (and thus works in the Edge Runtime) so we recommend using openai v4+ or openai-edge.
