# `AIStream`

AIStream has been removed in AI SDK 4.0. Use
`streamText.toDataStreamResponse()` instead.

Creates a readable stream for AI responses. This is based on the responses returned
by fetch and serves as the basis for the OpenAIStream and AnthropicStream. It allows
you to handle AI response streams in a controlled and customized manner that will
work with useChat and useCompletion.

AIStream will throw an error if response doesn't have a 2xx status code. This is to ensure that the stream is only created for successful responses.

## Import

### React

```
import { AIStream } from "ai"
```

## API Signature

Response

This is the response object returned by fetch. It's used as the source of the readable stream.

### customParser:

(AIStreamParser) => void

This is a function that is used to parse the events in the stream. It should return a function that receives a stringified chunk from the LLM and extracts the message content. The function is expected to return nothing (void) or a string.
