# `createAI`

AI SDK RSC is currently experimental. We recommend using [AI SDK
UI](../../ai-sdk-ui/overview.md) for production. For guidance on migrating from
RSC to UI, see our [migration guide](../../ai-sdk-rsc/migrating-to-ui.md).

Creates a client-server context provider that can be used to wrap parts of your application tree to easily manage both UI and AI states of your application.

## Import

```
import { createAI } from "@ai-sdk/rsc"
```

### onGetUIState:

() => UIState

is called during SSR to compare and update UI state.

### onSetAIState:
