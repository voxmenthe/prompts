# `render` (Removed)

"render" has been removed in AI SDK 4.0.

AI SDK RSC is currently experimental. We recommend using [AI SDK
UI](../../ai-sdk-ui/overview.md) for production. For guidance on migrating from
RSC to UI, see our [migration guide](../../ai-sdk-rsc/migrating-to-ui.md).

A helper function to create a streamable UI from LLM providers. This function is similar to AI SDK Core APIs and supports the same model interfaces.

> **Note**: `render` has been deprecated in favor of [`streamUI`](stream-ui.md). During migration, please ensure that the `messages` parameter follows the updated [specification](stream-ui.md#messages).
