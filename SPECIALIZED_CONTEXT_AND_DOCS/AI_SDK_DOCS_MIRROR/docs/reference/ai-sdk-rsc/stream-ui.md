# `streamUI`

AI SDK RSC is currently experimental. We recommend using [AI SDK
UI](../../ai-sdk-ui/overview.md) for production. For guidance on migrating from
RSC to UI, see our [migration guide](../../ai-sdk-rsc/migrating-to-ui.md).

A helper function to create a streamable UI from LLM providers. This function is similar to AI SDK Core APIs and supports the same model interfaces.

To see `streamUI` in action, check out [these examples](#examples).

### isError?:

boolean

Whether the result is an error or an error message.

### maxOutputTokens?:

number

Maximum number of tokens to generate.

### temperature?:

number

Temperature setting. The value is passed through to the provider. The range depends on the provider and model. It is recommended to set either `temperature` or `topP`, but not both.

### topP?:

number

Nucleus sampling. The value is passed through to the provider. The range depends on the provider and model. It is recommended to set either `temperature` or `topP`, but not both.

### topK?:

number

Only sample from the top K options for each subsequent token. Used to remove "long tail" low probability responses. Recommended for advanced use cases only. You usually only need to use temperature.

### presencePenalty?:

number

Presence penalty setting. It affects the likelihood of the model to repeat information that is already in the prompt. The value is passed through to the provider. The range depends on the provider and model.

### frequencyPenalty?:

number

Frequency penalty setting. It affects the likelihood of the model to repeatedly use the same words or phrases. The value is passed through to the provider. The range depends on the provider and model.

### stopSequences?:

string[]

Sequences that will stop the generation of the text. If the model generates any of these sequences, it will stop generating further text.

### seed?:

number

The seed (integer) to use for random sampling. If set and supported by the model, calls will generate deterministic results.

### maxRetries?:

number

Maximum number of retries. Set to 0 to disable retries. Default: 2.

### abortSignal?:

AbortSignal

An optional abort signal that can be used to cancel the call.

### headers?:

Record<string, string>

Additional HTTP headers to be sent with the request. Only applicable for HTTP-based providers.

### tools:

ToolSet

### description?:

string

Information about the purpose of the tool including details on how and when it can be used by the model.

### generate?:

(async (parameters) => ReactNode) | AsyncGenerator<ReactNode, ReactNode, void>

A function or a generator function that is called with the arguments from the tool call and yields React nodes as the UI.

### toolChoice?:

"auto" | "none" | "required" | { "type": "tool", "toolName": string }

The tool choice setting. It specifies how tools are selected for execution. The default is "auto". "none" disables tool execution. "required" requires tools to be executed. { "type": "tool", "toolName": string } specifies a specific tool to execute.

### text?:

(Text) => ReactNode

Callback to handle the generated tokens from the model.

### stream:
