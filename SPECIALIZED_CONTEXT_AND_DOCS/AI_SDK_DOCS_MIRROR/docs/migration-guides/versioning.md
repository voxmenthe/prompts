# Versioning

Each version number follows the format: `MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH`

- **Major**: Breaking API updates that require code changes.
- **Minor**: Blog post that aggregates new features and improvements into a public release that highlights benefits.
- **Patch**: New features and bug fixes.

## API Stability

We communicate the stability of our APIs as follows:

### Stable APIs

All APIs without special prefixes are considered stable and ready for production use. We maintain backward compatibility for stable features and only introduce breaking changes in major releases.

### Experimental APIs

APIs prefixed with `experimental_` or `Experimental_` (e.g. `experimental_generateImage()`) are in development and can change in any releases. To use experimental APIs safely:

1. Test them first in development, not production
2. Review release notes before upgrading
3. Prepare for potential code updates

If you use experimental APIs, make sure to pin your AI SDK version number
exactly (avoid using ^ or ~ version ranges) to prevent unexpected breaking
changes.

### Deprecated APIs

APIs marked as `deprecated` will be removed in future major releases. You can wait until the major release to update your code. To handle deprecations:

1. Switch to the recommended alternative API
2. Follow the migration guide (released alongside major releases)

For major releases, we provide automated codemods where possible to help
migrate your code to the new version.
