# AI SDK Core

Large Language Models (LLMs) are advanced programs that can understand, create, and engage with human language on a large scale.
They are trained on vast amounts of written material to recognize patterns in language and predict what might come next in a given piece of text.

AI SDK Core **simplifies working with LLMs by offering a standardized way of integrating them into your app** - so you can focus on building great AI applications for your users, not waste time on technical details.

For example, hereâ€™s how you can generate text with various models using the AI SDK:

import { generateText } from "ai"

import { xai } from "@ai-sdk/xai"

const { text } = await generateText({

model: xai("grok-4"),

prompt: "What is love?"

})

Love is a universal emotion that is characterized by feelings of affection, attachment, and warmth towards someone or something. It is a complex and multifaceted experience that can take many different forms, including romantic love, familial love, platonic love, and self-love.

## AI SDK Core Functions

AI SDK Core has various functions designed for [text generation](generating-text.md), [structured data generation](generating-structured-data.md), and [tool usage](tools-and-tool-calling.md).
These functions take a standardized approach to setting up [prompts](prompts.md) and [settings](settings.md), making it easier to work with different models.

- [`generateText`](generating-text.md): Generates text and [tool calls](tools-and-tool-calling.md).
  This function is ideal for non-interactive use cases such as automation tasks where you need to write text (e.g. drafting email or summarizing web pages) and for agents that use tools.
- [`streamText`](generating-text.md): Stream text and tool calls.
  You can use the `streamText` function for interactive use cases such as [chat bots](../ai-sdk-ui/chatbot.md) and [content streaming](../ai-sdk-ui/completion.md).
- [`generateObject`](generating-structured-data.md): Generates a typed, structured object that matches a [Zod](https://zod.dev/) schema.
  You can use this function to force the language model to return structured data, e.g. for information extraction, synthetic data generation, or classification tasks.
- [`streamObject`](generating-structured-data.md): Stream a structured object that matches a Zod schema.
  You can use this function to [stream generated UIs](../ai-sdk-ui/object-generation.md).
