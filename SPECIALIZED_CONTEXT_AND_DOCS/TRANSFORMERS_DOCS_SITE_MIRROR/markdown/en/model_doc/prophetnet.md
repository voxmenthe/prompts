# ProphetNet

## Overview

The ProphetNet model was proposed in [ProphetNet: Predicting Future N-gram for Sequence-to-Sequence Pre-training,](https://huggingface.co/papers/2001.04063) by Yu Yan, Weizhen Qi, Yeyun Gong, Dayiheng Liu, Nan Duan, Jiusheng Chen, Ruofei
Zhang, Ming Zhou on 13 Jan, 2020.

ProphetNet is an encoder-decoder model and can predict n-future tokens for "ngram" language modeling instead of just
the next token.

The abstract from the paper is the following:

*In this paper, we present a new sequence-to-sequence pretraining model called ProphetNet, which introduces a novel
self-supervised objective named future n-gram prediction and the proposed n-stream self-attention mechanism. Instead of
the optimization of one-step ahead prediction in traditional sequence-to-sequence model, the ProphetNet is optimized by
n-step ahead prediction which predicts the next n tokens simultaneously based on previous context tokens at each time
step. The future n-gram prediction explicitly encourages the model to plan for the future tokens and prevent
overfitting on strong local correlations. We pre-train ProphetNet using a base scale dataset (16GB) and a large scale
dataset (160GB) respectively. Then we conduct experiments on CNN/DailyMail, Gigaword, and SQuAD 1.1 benchmarks for
abstractive summarization and question generation tasks. Experimental results show that ProphetNet achieves new
state-of-the-art results on all these datasets compared to the models using the same scale pretraining corpus.*

## Usage tips

- ProphetNet is a model with absolute position embeddings so it's usually advised to pad the inputs on the right rather than
  the left.
- The model architecture is based on the original Transformer, but replaces the “standard” self-attention mechanism in the decoder by a main self-attention mechanism and a self and n-stream (predict) self-attention mechanism.

  Indices of input sequence tokens in the vocabulary. Padding will be ignored by default.

  Indices can be obtained using [AutoTokenizer](/docs/transformers/main/en/model_doc/auto#transformers.AutoTokenizer). See [PreTrainedTokenizer.encode()](/docs/transformers/main/en/internal/tokenization_utils#transformers.PreTrainedTokenizerBase.encode) and

  [What are input IDs?](../glossary#input-ids)
- **attention_mask** (`torch.Tensor` of shape `(batch_size, sequence_length)`, *optional*) --
  Mask to avoid performing attention on padding token indices. Mask values selected in `[0, 1]`:

  - 1 for tokens that are **not masked**,
  - 0 for tokens that are **masked**.

  [What are attention masks?](../glossary#attention-mask)
- **decoder_input_ids** (`torch.LongTensor` of shape `(batch_size, target_sequence_length)`, *optional*) --
  Indices of decoder input sequence tokens in the vocabulary.

  Indices can be obtained using [AutoTokenizer](/docs/transformers/main/en/model_doc/auto#transformers.AutoTokenizer). See [PreTrainedTokenizer.encode()](/docs/transformers/main/en/internal/tokenization_utils#transformers.PreTrainedTokenizerBase.encode) and

  [What are decoder input IDs?](../glossary#decoder-input-ids)

  ProphetNet uses the `eos_token_id` as the starting token for `decoder_input_ids` generation. If
  `past_key_values` is used, optionally only the last `decoder_input_ids` have to be input (see
  `past_key_values`).
- **decoder_attention_mask** (`torch.BoolTensor` of shape `(batch_size, target_sequence_length)`, *optional*) --
  Default behavior: generate a tensor that ignores pad tokens in `decoder_input_ids`. Causal mask will also
  be used by default.
- **encoder_outputs** (`tuple`, *optional*) --
  Tuple consists of (`last_hidden_state`, *optional*: `hidden_states`, *optional*: `attentions`)
  `last_hidden_state` of shape `(batch_size, sequence_length, hidden_size)`, *optional*) is a sequence of
  hidden-states at the output of the last layer of the encoder. Used in the cross-attention of the decoder.
- **past_key_values** (`~cache_utils.Cache`, *optional*) --
  Pre-computed hidden-states (key and values in the self-attention blocks and in the cross-attention
  blocks) that can be used to speed up sequential decoding. This typically consists in the `past_key_values`
  returned by the model at a previous stage of decoding, when `use_cache=True` or `config.use_cache=True`.

  Only [Cache](/docs/transformers/main/en/internal/generation_utils#transformers.Cache) instance is allowed as input, see our [kv cache guide](https://huggingface.co/docs/transformers/en/kv_cache).
  If no `past_key_values` are passed, [DynamicCache](/docs/transformers/main/en/internal/generation_utils#transformers.DynamicCache) will be initialized by default.

  The model will output the same cache format that is fed as input.

  If `past_key_values` are used, the user is expected to input only unprocessed `input_ids` (those that don't
  have their past key value states given to this model) of shape `(batch_size, unprocessed_length)` instead of all `input_ids`
  of shape `(batch_size, sequence_length)`.
- **inputs_embeds** (`torch.Tensor` of shape `(batch_size, sequence_length, hidden_size)`, *optional*) --
  Optionally, instead of passing `input_ids` you can choose to directly pass an embedded representation. This
  is useful if you want more control over how to convert `input_ids` indices into associated vectors than the
  model's internal embedding lookup matrix.
- **decoder_inputs_embeds** (`torch.Tensor` of shape `(batch_size, target_sequence_length, hidden_size)`, *optional*) --
  Optionally, instead of passing `decoder_input_ids` you can choose to directly pass an embedded
  representation. If `past_key_values` is used, optionally only the last `decoder_inputs_embeds` have to be
  input (see `past_key_values`). This is useful if you want more control over how to convert
  `decoder_input_ids` indices into associated vectors than the model's internal embedding lookup matrix.

  If `decoder_input_ids` and `decoder_inputs_embeds` are both unset, `decoder_inputs_embeds` takes the value
  of `inputs_embeds`.
- **use_cache** (`bool`, *optional*) --
  If set to `True`, `past_key_values` key value states are returned and can be used to speed up decoding (see
  `past_key_values`).
- **output_attentions** (`bool`, *optional*) --
  Whether or not to return the attentions tensors of all attention layers. See `attentions` under returned
  tensors for more detail.
- **output_hidden_states** (`bool`, *optional*) --
  Whether or not to return the hidden states of all layers. See `hidden_states` under returned tensors for
  more detail.
- **return_dict** (`bool`, *optional*) --
  Whether or not to return a [ModelOutput](/docs/transformers/main/en/main_classes/output#transformers.utils.ModelOutput) instead of a plain tuple.
- **cache_position** (`torch.Tensor` of shape `(sequence_length)`, *optional*) --
  Indices depicting the position of the input sequence tokens in the sequence. Contrarily to `position_ids`,
  this tensor is not affected by padding. It is used to update the cache in the correct position and to infer
  the complete sequence length.0[transformers.models.prophetnet.modeling_prophetnet.ProphetNetSeq2SeqModelOutput](/docs/transformers/main/en/model_doc/prophetnet#transformers.models.prophetnet.modeling_prophetnet.ProphetNetSeq2SeqModelOutput) or `tuple(torch.FloatTensor)`A [transformers.models.prophetnet.modeling_prophetnet.ProphetNetSeq2SeqModelOutput](/docs/transformers/main/en/model_doc/prophetnet#transformers.models.prophetnet.modeling_prophetnet.ProphetNetSeq2SeqModelOutput) or a tuple of

- **last_hidden_state_ngram** (`torch.FloatTensor` of shape `(batch_size,ngram * decoder_sequence_length, config.vocab_size)`, *optional*) -- Sequence of predict stream hidden-states at the output of the last layer of the decoder of the model.

The [ProphetNetModel](/docs/transformers/main/en/model_doc/prophetnet#transformers.ProphetNetModel) forward method, overrides the `__call__` special method.

Although the recipe for forward pass needs to be defined within this function, one should call the `Module`
instance afterwards instead of this since the former takes care of running the pre and post processing steps while
the latter silently ignores them.

Example:

```python
>>> from transformers import AutoTokenizer, ProphetNetModel

>>> tokenizer = AutoTokenizer.from_pretrained("microsoft/prophetnet-large-uncased")
>>> model = ProphetNetModel.from_pretrained("microsoft/prophetnet-large-uncased")

>>> input_ids = tokenizer(
...     "Studies have been shown that owning a dog is good for you", return_tensors="pt"
... ).input_ids  # Batch size 1
>>> decoder_input_ids = tokenizer("Studies show that", return_tensors="pt").input_ids  # Batch size 1
>>> outputs = model(input_ids=input_ids, decoder_input_ids=decoder_input_ids)

>>> last_hidden_states = outputs.last_hidden_state  # main stream hidden states
>>> last_hidden_states_ngram = outputs.last_hidden_state_ngram  # predict hidden states
```

**Parameters:**

The [ProphetNetDecoder](/docs/transformers/main/en/model_doc/prophetnet#transformers.ProphetNetDecoder) forward method, overrides the `__call__` special method.

Although the recipe for forward pass needs to be defined within this function, one should call the `Module`
instance afterwards instead of this since the former takes care of running the pre and post processing steps while
the latter silently ignores them.

Example:

```python
>>> from transformers import AutoTokenizer, ProphetNetDecoder
>>> import torch

>>> tokenizer = AutoTokenizer.from_pretrained("microsoft/prophetnet-large-uncased")
>>> model = ProphetNetDecoder.from_pretrained("microsoft/prophetnet-large-uncased", add_cross_attention=False)
>>> inputs = tokenizer("Hello, my dog is cute", return_tensors="pt")
>>> outputs = model(**inputs)

>>> last_hidden_states = outputs.last_hidden_state
```

#### transformers.ProphetNetForConditionalGeneration[[transformers.ProphetNetForConditionalGeneration]]

[Source](https://github.com/huggingface/transformers/blob/main/src/transformers/models/prophetnet/modeling_prophetnet.py#L1510)

The ProphetNet Model with a language modeling head. Can be used for sequence generation tasks.

This model inherits from [PreTrainedModel](/docs/transformers/main/en/main_classes/model#transformers.PreTrainedModel). Check the superclass documentation for the generic methods the
library implements for all its model (such as downloading or saving, resizing the input embeddings, pruning heads
etc.)

This model is also a PyTorch [torch.nn.Module](https://pytorch.org/docs/stable/nn.html#torch.nn.Module) subclass.
Use it as a regular PyTorch Module and refer to the PyTorch documentation for all matter related to general usage
and behavior.

  Indices of input sequence tokens in the vocabulary. Padding will be ignored by default.

  Indices can be obtained using [AutoTokenizer](/docs/transformers/main/en/model_doc/auto#transformers.AutoTokenizer). See [PreTrainedTokenizer.encode()](/docs/transformers/main/en/internal/tokenization_utils#transformers.PreTrainedTokenizerBase.encode) and

  Mask to avoid performing attention on padding token indices. Mask values selected in `[0, 1]`:

  - 1 for tokens that are **not masked**,
  - 0 for tokens that are **masked**.

  [What are attention masks?](../glossary#attention-mask)
- **decoder_input_ids** (`torch.LongTensor` of shape `(batch_size, target_sequence_length)`, *optional*) --
  Indices of decoder input sequence tokens in the vocabulary.

  Indices can be obtained using [AutoTokenizer](/docs/transformers/main/en/model_doc/auto#transformers.AutoTokenizer). See [PreTrainedTokenizer.encode()](/docs/transformers/main/en/internal/tokenization_utils#transformers.PreTrainedTokenizerBase.encode) and

  [What are decoder input IDs?](../glossary#decoder-input-ids)

  ProphetNet uses the `eos_token_id` as the starting token for `decoder_input_ids` generation. If
  `past_key_values` is used, optionally only the last `decoder_input_ids` have to be input (see
  `past_key_values`).
- **decoder_attention_mask** (`torch.BoolTensor` of shape `(batch_size, target_sequence_length)`, *optional*) --
  Default behavior: generate a tensor that ignores pad tokens in `decoder_input_ids`. Causal mask will also
  be used by default.
- **encoder_outputs** (`torch.Tensor`, *optional*) --
  Tuple consists of (`last_hidden_state`, *optional*: `hidden_states`, *optional*: `attentions`)
  `last_hidden_state` of shape `(batch_size, sequence_length, hidden_size)`, *optional*) is a sequence of
  hidden-states at the output of the last layer of the encoder. Used in the cross-attention of the decoder.

  Pre-computed hidden-states (key and values in the self-attention blocks and in the cross-attention
  blocks) that can be used to speed up sequential decoding. This typically consists in the `past_key_values`
  returned by the model at a previous stage of decoding, when `use_cache=True` or `config.use_cache=True`.

  Only [Cache](/docs/transformers/main/en/internal/generation_utils#transformers.Cache) instance is allowed as input, see our [kv cache guide](https://huggingface.co/docs/transformers/en/kv_cache).
  If no `past_key_values` are passed, [DynamicCache](/docs/transformers/main/en/internal/generation_utils#transformers.DynamicCache) will be initialized by default.

  The model will output the same cache format that is fed as input.

  If `past_key_values` are used, the user is expected to input only unprocessed `input_ids` (those that don't
  have their past key value states given to this model) of shape `(batch_size, unprocessed_length)` instead of all `input_ids`
  of shape `(batch_size, sequence_length)`.
- **inputs_embeds** (`torch.Tensor` of shape `(batch_size, sequence_length, hidden_size)`, *optional*) --
  Optionally, instead of passing `input_ids` you can choose to directly pass an embedded representation. This

  of `inputs_embeds`.
- **labels** (`torch.LongTensor` of shape `(batch_size,)`, *optional*) --
  Labels for computing the sequence classification/regression loss. Indices should be in `[-100, 0, ...,
  config.vocab_size - 1]`. All labels set to `-100` are ignored (masked), the loss is only computed for
  labels in `[0, ..., config.vocab_size]`

[Source](https://github.com/huggingface/transformers/blob/main/src/transformers/models/prophetnet/modeling_prophetnet.py#L1686)

The standalone decoder part of the ProphetNetModel with a lm head on top. The model can be used for causal

This model inherits from [PreTrainedModel](/docs/transformers/main/en/main_classes/model#transformers.PreTrainedModel). Check the superclass documentation for the generic methods the
library implements for all its model (such as downloading or saving, resizing the input embeddings, pruning heads
etc.)

This model is also a PyTorch [torch.nn.Module](https://pytorch.org/docs/stable/nn.html#torch.nn.Module) subclass.
Use it as a regular PyTorch Module and refer to the PyTorch documentation for all matter related to general usage
and behavior.

  Indices of input sequence tokens in the vocabulary. Padding will be ignored by default.

  Indices can be obtained using [AutoTokenizer](/docs/transformers/main/en/model_doc/auto#transformers.AutoTokenizer). See [PreTrainedTokenizer.encode()](/docs/transformers/main/en/internal/tokenization_utils#transformers.PreTrainedTokenizerBase.encode) and
  [PreTrainedTokenizer.__call__()](/docs/transformers/main/en/internal/tokenization_utils#transformers.PreTrainedTokenizerBase.__call__) for details.

  [What are input IDs?](../glossary#input-ids)
- **attention_mask** (`torch.Tensor` of shape `(batch_size, sequence_length)`, *optional*) --
  Mask to avoid performing attention on padding token indices. Mask values selected in `[0, 1]`:

  - 1 for tokens that are **not masked**,
  - 0 for tokens that are **masked**.

  [What are attention masks?](../glossary#attention-mask)
- **encoder_hidden_states** (`torch.Tensor` of shape `(batch_size, sequence_length, hidden_size)`, *optional*) --
  Sequence of hidden-states at the output of the last layer of the encoder. Used in the cross-attention
  if the model is configured as a decoder.
- **encoder_attention_mask** (`torch.Tensor` of shape `(batch_size, sequence_length)`, *optional*) --
  Mask to avoid performing attention on the padding token indices of the encoder input. This mask is used in
  the cross-attention if the model is configured as a decoder. Mask values selected in `[0, 1]`:

  - 1 for tokens that are **not masked**,
  - 0 for tokens that are **masked**.
- **past_key_values** (`~cache_utils.Cache`, *optional*) --
  Pre-computed hidden-states (key and values in the self-attention blocks and in the cross-attention
  blocks) that can be used to speed up sequential decoding. This typically consists in the `past_key_values`
  returned by the model at a previous stage of decoding, when `use_cache=True` or `config.use_cache=True`.

  Only [Cache](/docs/transformers/main/en/internal/generation_utils#transformers.Cache) instance is allowed as input, see our [kv cache guide](https://huggingface.co/docs/transformers/en/kv_cache).
  If no `past_key_values` are passed, [DynamicCache](/docs/transformers/main/en/internal/generation_utils#transformers.DynamicCache) will be initialized by default.

  The model will output the same cache format that is fed as input.

  If `past_key_values` are used, the user is expected to input only unprocessed `input_ids` (those that don't
  have their past key value states given to this model) of shape `(batch_size, unprocessed_length)` instead of all `input_ids`
  of shape `(batch_size, sequence_length)`.
- **inputs_embeds** (`torch.Tensor` of shape `(batch_size, sequence_length, hidden_size)`, *optional*) --
  Optionally, instead of passing `input_ids` you can choose to directly pass an embedded representation. This
  is useful if you want more control over how to convert `input_ids` indices into associated vectors than the
  model's internal embedding lookup matrix.
- **labels** (`torch.LongTensor` of shape `(batch_size, sequence_length)`, *optional*) --
  Labels for computing the left-to-right language modeling loss (next word prediction). Indices should be in
  `[-100, 0, ..., config.vocab_size]` (see `input_ids` docstring) Tokens with indices set to `-100` are
  ignored (masked), the loss is only computed for the tokens with labels n `[0, ..., config.vocab_size]`
- **use_cache** (`bool`, *optional*) --
  If set to `True`, `past_key_values` key value states are returned and can be used to speed up decoding (see
  `past_key_values`).
- **output_attentions** (`bool`, *optional*) --
  Whether or not to return the attentions tensors of all attention layers. See `attentions` under returned
  tensors for more detail.
- **output_hidden_states** (`bool`, *optional*) --
  Whether or not to return the hidden states of all layers. See `hidden_states` under returned tensors for
  more detail.
- **return_dict** (`bool`, *optional*) --
  Whether or not to return a [ModelOutput](/docs/transformers/main/en/main_classes/output#transformers.utils.ModelOutput) instead of a plain tuple.0[transformers.models.prophetnet.modeling_prophetnet.ProphetNetDecoderLMOutput](/docs/transformers/main/en/model_doc/prophetnet#transformers.models.prophetnet.modeling_prophetnet.ProphetNetDecoderLMOutput) or `tuple(torch.FloatTensor)`A [transformers.models.prophetnet.modeling_prophetnet.ProphetNetDecoderLMOutput](/docs/transformers/main/en/model_doc/prophetnet#transformers.models.prophetnet.modeling_prophetnet.ProphetNetDecoderLMOutput) or a tuple of

The [ProphetNetForCausalLM](/docs/transformers/main/en/model_doc/prophetnet#transformers.ProphetNetForCausalLM) forward method, overrides the `__call__` special method.

Although the recipe for forward pass needs to be defined within this function, one should call the `Module`
instance afterwards instead of this since the former takes care of running the pre and post processing steps while
the latter silently ignores them.

Example:

```python
>>> from transformers import AutoTokenizer, ProphetNetForCausalLM
>>> import torch

>>> tokenizer = AutoTokenizer.from_pretrained("microsoft/prophetnet-large-uncased")
>>> model = ProphetNetForCausalLM.from_pretrained("microsoft/prophetnet-large-uncased")
>>> assert model.config.is_decoder, f"{model.__class__} has to be configured as a decoder."
>>> inputs = tokenizer("Hello, my dog is cute", return_tensors="pt")
>>> outputs = model(**inputs)

>>> logits = outputs.logits

>>> # Model can also be used with EncoderDecoder framework
>>> from transformers import BertTokenizer, EncoderDecoderModel, AutoTokenizer
>>> import torch

>>> tokenizer_enc = BertTokenizer.from_pretrained("google-bert/bert-large-uncased")
>>> tokenizer_dec = AutoTokenizer.from_pretrained("microsoft/prophetnet-large-uncased")
>>> model = EncoderDecoderModel.from_encoder_decoder_pretrained(
...     "google-bert/bert-large-uncased", "microsoft/prophetnet-large-uncased"
... )

>>> ARTICLE = (
...     "the us state department said wednesday it had received no "
...     "formal word from bolivia that it was expelling the us ambassador there "
...     "but said the charges made against him are `` baseless ."
... )
>>> input_ids = tokenizer_enc(ARTICLE, return_tensors="pt").input_ids
>>> labels = tokenizer_dec(
...     "us rejects charges against its ambassador in bolivia", return_tensors="pt"
... ).input_ids
>>> outputs = model(input_ids=input_ids, decoder_input_ids=labels[:, :-1], labels=labels[:, 1:])

>>> loss = outputs.loss
```
