# BigBirdPegasus

[BigBirdPegasus](https://huggingface.co/papers/2007.14062) is an encoder-decoder (sequence-to-sequence) transformer model for long-input summarization. It extends the [BigBird](./big_bird) architecture with an additional pretraining objective borrowed from [Pegasus](./pegasus) called gap sequence generation (GSG). Whole sentences are masked and the model has to fill in the gaps in the document. BigBirdPegasus's ability to keep track of long contexts makes it effective at summarizing lengthy inputs, surpassing the performance of base Pegasus models.

You can find all the original BigBirdPegasus checkpoints under the [Google](https://huggingface.co/google/models?search=bigbird-pegasus) organization.

## Notes

- BigBirdPegasus also uses the [PegasusTokenizer](/docs/transformers/main/en/model_doc/pegasus#transformers.PegasusTokenizer).
- Inputs should be padded on the right because BigBird uses absolute position embeddings.
- BigBirdPegasus supports `original_full` and `block_sparse` attention. If the input sequence length is less than 1024, it is recommended to use `original_full` since sparse patterns don't offer much benefit for smaller inputs.
- The current implementation uses window size of 3 blocks and 2 global blocks, only supports the ITC-implementation, and doesn't support `num_random_blocks=0`.
- The sequence length must be divisible by the block size.

library implements for all its model (such as downloading or saving, resizing the input embeddings, pruning heads
etc.)

This model is also a PyTorch [torch.nn.Module](https://pytorch.org/docs/stable/nn.html#torch.nn.Module) subclass.

  Indices of input sequence tokens in the vocabulary. Padding will be ignored by default.

  Indices can be obtained using [AutoTokenizer](/docs/transformers/main/en/model_doc/auto#transformers.AutoTokenizer). See [PreTrainedTokenizer.encode()](/docs/transformers/main/en/internal/tokenization_utils#transformers.PreTrainedTokenizerBase.encode) and
  [PreTrainedTokenizer.__call__()](/docs/transformers/main/en/internal/tokenization_utils#transformers.PreTrainedTokenizerBase.__call__) for details.

  [What are input IDs?](../glossary#input-ids)
- **attention_mask** (`torch.Tensor` of shape `(batch_size, sequence_length)`, *optional*) --
  Mask to avoid performing attention on padding token indices. Mask values selected in `[0, 1]`:

  - 1 for tokens that are **not masked**,
  - 0 for tokens that are **masked**.

  [What are attention masks?](../glossary#attention-mask)
- **decoder_input_ids** (`torch.LongTensor` of shape `(batch_size, target_sequence_length)`, *optional*) --
  Provide for translation and summarization training. By default, the model will create this tensor by
  shifting the `input_ids` to the right, following the paper.
- **decoder_attention_mask** (`torch.LongTensor` of shape `(batch_size, target_sequence_length)`, *optional*) --
  Default behavior: generate a tensor that ignores pad tokens in `decoder_input_ids`. Causal mask will also
  be used by default.

  If you want to change padding behavior, you should read
  `modeling_bigbird_pegasus._prepare_decoder_attention_mask` and modify to your needs. See diagram 1 in
  [the paper](https://huggingface.co/papers/1910.13461) for more information on the default strategy.
- **encoder_outputs** (`list[torch.FloatTensor]`, *optional*) --
  Tuple consists of (`last_hidden_state`, *optional*: `hidden_states`, *optional*: `attentions`)
  `last_hidden_state` of shape `(batch_size, sequence_length, hidden_size)`, *optional*) is a sequence of
  hidden-states at the output of the last layer of the encoder. Used in the cross-attention of the decoder.
- **past_key_values** (`~cache_utils.Cache`, *optional*) --
  Pre-computed hidden-states (key and values in the self-attention blocks and in the cross-attention
  blocks) that can be used to speed up sequential decoding. This typically consists in the `past_key_values`
  returned by the model at a previous stage of decoding, when `use_cache=True` or `config.use_cache=True`.

  Only [Cache](/docs/transformers/main/en/internal/generation_utils#transformers.Cache) instance is allowed as input, see our [kv cache guide](https://huggingface.co/docs/transformers/en/kv_cache).
  If no `past_key_values` are passed, [DynamicCache](/docs/transformers/main/en/internal/generation_utils#transformers.DynamicCache) will be initialized by default.

  The model will output the same cache format that is fed as input.

  If `past_key_values` are used, the user is expected to input only unprocessed `input_ids` (those that don't
  have their past key value states given to this model) of shape `(batch_size, unprocessed_length)` instead of all `input_ids`
  of shape `(batch_size, sequence_length)`.
- **inputs_embeds** (`torch.FloatTensor` of shape `(batch_size, sequence_length, hidden_size)`, *optional*) --
  Optionally, instead of passing `input_ids` you can choose to directly pass an embedded representation. This
  is useful if you want more control over how to convert `input_ids` indices into associated vectors than the
  model's internal embedding lookup matrix.
- **decoder_inputs_embeds** (`torch.FloatTensor` of shape `(batch_size, target_sequence_length, hidden_size)`, *optional*) --
  Optionally, instead of passing `decoder_input_ids` you can choose to directly pass an embedded
  representation. If `past_key_values` is used, optionally only the last `decoder_inputs_embeds` have to be
  input (see `past_key_values`). This is useful if you want more control over how to convert
  `decoder_input_ids` indices into associated vectors than the model's internal embedding lookup matrix.

  If `decoder_input_ids` and `decoder_inputs_embeds` are both unset, `decoder_inputs_embeds` takes the value
  of `inputs_embeds`.
- **use_cache** (`bool`, *optional*) --
  If set to `True`, `past_key_values` key value states are returned and can be used to speed up decoding (see
  `past_key_values`).
- **output_attentions** (`bool`, *optional*) --
  Whether or not to return the attentions tensors of all attention layers. See `attentions` under returned
  tensors for more detail.
- **output_hidden_states** (`bool`, *optional*) --
  Whether or not to return the hidden states of all layers. See `hidden_states` under returned tensors for
  more detail.
- **return_dict** (`bool`, *optional*) --
  Whether or not to return a [ModelOutput](/docs/transformers/main/en/main_classes/output#transformers.utils.ModelOutput) instead of a plain tuple.
- **cache_position** (`torch.LongTensor` of shape `(sequence_length)`, *optional*) --
  Indices depicting the position of the input sequence tokens in the sequence. Contrarily to `position_ids`,
  this tensor is not affected by padding. It is used to update the cache in the correct position and to infer
  the complete sequence length.0[transformers.modeling_outputs.Seq2SeqModelOutput](/docs/transformers/main/en/main_classes/output#transformers.modeling_outputs.Seq2SeqModelOutput) or `tuple(torch.FloatTensor)`A [transformers.modeling_outputs.Seq2SeqModelOutput](/docs/transformers/main/en/main_classes/output#transformers.modeling_outputs.Seq2SeqModelOutput) or a tuple of

- **last_hidden_state** (`torch.FloatTensor` of shape `(batch_size, sequence_length, hidden_size)`) -- Sequence of hidden-states at the output of the last layer of the decoder of the model.

  If `past_key_values` is used only the last hidden-state of the sequences of shape `(batch_size, 1,
  hidden_size)` is output.
- **past_key_values** (`EncoderDecoderCache`, *optional*, returned when `use_cache=True` is passed or when `config.use_cache=True`) -- It is a [EncoderDecoderCache](/docs/transformers/main/en/internal/generation_utils#transformers.EncoderDecoderCache) instance.

The [BigBirdPegasusModel](/docs/transformers/main/en/model_doc/bigbird_pegasus#transformers.BigBirdPegasusModel) forward method, overrides the `__call__` special method.

Although the recipe for forward pass needs to be defined within this function, one should call the `Module`
instance afterwards instead of this since the former takes care of running the pre and post processing steps while
the latter silently ignores them.

  Indices of input sequence tokens in the vocabulary. Padding will be ignored by default.

  Indices can be obtained using [AutoTokenizer](/docs/transformers/main/en/model_doc/auto#transformers.AutoTokenizer). See [PreTrainedTokenizer.encode()](/docs/transformers/main/en/internal/tokenization_utils#transformers.PreTrainedTokenizerBase.encode) and
  [PreTrainedTokenizer.__call__()](/docs/transformers/main/en/internal/tokenization_utils#transformers.PreTrainedTokenizerBase.__call__) for details.

  [What are input IDs?](../glossary#input-ids)
- **attention_mask** (`torch.Tensor` of shape `(batch_size, sequence_length)`, *optional*) --
  Mask to avoid performing attention on padding token indices. Mask values selected in `[0, 1]`:

  - 1 for tokens that are **not masked**,
  - 0 for tokens that are **masked**.

  [What are attention masks?](../glossary#attention-mask)
- **decoder_input_ids** (`torch.LongTensor` of shape `(batch_size, target_sequence_length)`, *optional*) --
  Provide for translation and summarization training. By default, the model will create this tensor by
  shifting the `input_ids` to the right, following the paper.
- **decoder_attention_mask** (`torch.LongTensor` of shape `(batch_size, target_sequence_length)`, *optional*) --
  Default behavior: generate a tensor that ignores pad tokens in `decoder_input_ids`. Causal mask will also
  be used by default.

  If you want to change padding behavior, you should read
  `modeling_bigbird_pegasus._prepare_decoder_attention_mask` and modify to your needs. See diagram 1 in
  [the paper](https://huggingface.co/papers/1910.13461) for more information on the default strategy.
- **encoder_outputs** (`list[torch.FloatTensor]`, *optional*) --
  Tuple consists of (`last_hidden_state`, *optional*: `hidden_states`, *optional*: `attentions`)
  `last_hidden_state` of shape `(batch_size, sequence_length, hidden_size)`, *optional*) is a sequence of
  hidden-states at the output of the last layer of the encoder. Used in the cross-attention of the decoder.
- **past_key_values** (`~cache_utils.Cache`, *optional*) --
  Pre-computed hidden-states (key and values in the self-attention blocks and in the cross-attention
  blocks) that can be used to speed up sequential decoding. This typically consists in the `past_key_values`
  returned by the model at a previous stage of decoding, when `use_cache=True` or `config.use_cache=True`.

  Only [Cache](/docs/transformers/main/en/internal/generation_utils#transformers.Cache) instance is allowed as input, see our [kv cache guide](https://huggingface.co/docs/transformers/en/kv_cache).
  If no `past_key_values` are passed, [DynamicCache](/docs/transformers/main/en/internal/generation_utils#transformers.DynamicCache) will be initialized by default.

  The model will output the same cache format that is fed as input.

  If `past_key_values` are used, the user is expected to input only unprocessed `input_ids` (those that don't
  have their past key value states given to this model) of shape `(batch_size, unprocessed_length)` instead of all `input_ids`
  of shape `(batch_size, sequence_length)`.
- **inputs_embeds** (`torch.FloatTensor` of shape `(batch_size, sequence_length, hidden_size)`, *optional*) --
  Optionally, instead of passing `input_ids` you can choose to directly pass an embedded representation. This
  is useful if you want more control over how to convert `input_ids` indices into associated vectors than the
  model's internal embedding lookup matrix.
- **decoder_inputs_embeds** (`torch.FloatTensor` of shape `(batch_size, target_sequence_length, hidden_size)`, *optional*) --
  Optionally, instead of passing `decoder_input_ids` you can choose to directly pass an embedded
  representation. If `past_key_values` is used, optionally only the last `decoder_inputs_embeds` have to be
  input (see `past_key_values`). This is useful if you want more control over how to convert
  `decoder_input_ids` indices into associated vectors than the model's internal embedding lookup matrix.

  If `decoder_input_ids` and `decoder_inputs_embeds` are both unset, `decoder_inputs_embeds` takes the value
  of `inputs_embeds`.
- **labels** (`torch.LongTensor` of shape `(batch_size, sequence_length)`, *optional*) --
  Labels for computing the masked language modeling loss. Indices should either be in `[0, ...,
  config.vocab_size]` or -100 (see `input_ids` docstring). Tokens with indices set to `-100` are ignored
  (masked), the loss is only computed for the tokens with labels in `[0, ..., config.vocab_size]`.
- **use_cache** (`bool`, *optional*) --
  If set to `True`, `past_key_values` key value states are returned and can be used to speed up decoding (see
  `past_key_values`).
- **output_attentions** (`bool`, *optional*) --
  Whether or not to return the attentions tensors of all attention layers. See `attentions` under returned
  tensors for more detail.
- **output_hidden_states** (`bool`, *optional*) --
  Whether or not to return the hidden states of all layers. See `hidden_states` under returned tensors for
  more detail.
- **return_dict** (`bool`, *optional*) --
  Whether or not to return a [ModelOutput](/docs/transformers/main/en/main_classes/output#transformers.utils.ModelOutput) instead of a plain tuple.
- **cache_position** (`torch.LongTensor` of shape `(sequence_length)`, *optional*) --
  Indices depicting the position of the input sequence tokens in the sequence. Contrarily to `position_ids`,
  this tensor is not affected by padding. It is used to update the cache in the correct position and to infer
  the complete sequence length.0[transformers.modeling_outputs.Seq2SeqLMOutput](/docs/transformers/main/en/main_classes/output#transformers.modeling_outputs.Seq2SeqLMOutput) or `tuple(torch.FloatTensor)`A [transformers.modeling_outputs.Seq2SeqLMOutput](/docs/transformers/main/en/main_classes/output#transformers.modeling_outputs.Seq2SeqLMOutput) or a tuple of

elements depending on the configuration ([BigBirdPegasusConfig](/docs/transformers/main/en/model_doc/bigbird_pegasus#transformers.BigBirdPegasusConfig)) and inputs.

- **loss** (`torch.FloatTensor` of shape `(1,)`, *optional*, returned when `labels` is provided) -- Language modeling loss.
- **logits** (`torch.FloatTensor` of shape `(batch_size, sequence_length, config.vocab_size)`) -- Prediction scores of the language modeling head (scores for each vocabulary token before SoftMax).
- **past_key_values** (`EncoderDecoderCache`, *optional*, returned when `use_cache=True` is passed or when `config.use_cache=True`) -- It is a [EncoderDecoderCache](/docs/transformers/main/en/internal/generation_utils#transformers.EncoderDecoderCache) instance.

  one for the output of each layer) of shape `(batch_size, sequence_length, hidden_size)`.

  Hidden-states of the decoder at the output of each layer plus the initial embedding outputs.
- **decoder_attentions** (`tuple(torch.FloatTensor)`, *optional*, returned when `output_attentions=True` is passed or when `config.output_attentions=True`) -- Tuple of `torch.FloatTensor` (one for each layer) of shape `(batch_size, num_heads, sequence_length,
  sequence_length)`.

  Attentions weights of the decoder, after the attention softmax, used to compute the weighted average in the
  self-attention heads.

  sequence_length)`.

The [BigBirdPegasusForConditionalGeneration](/docs/transformers/main/en/model_doc/bigbird_pegasus#transformers.BigBirdPegasusForConditionalGeneration) forward method, overrides the `__call__` special method.

Although the recipe for forward pass needs to be defined within this function, one should call the `Module`
instance afterwards instead of this since the former takes care of running the pre and post processing steps while
the latter silently ignores them.

for GLUE tasks.

This model inherits from [PreTrainedModel](/docs/transformers/main/en/main_classes/model#transformers.PreTrainedModel). Check the superclass documentation for the generic methods the

The Bigbird Pegasus transformer with a span classification head on top for extractive question-answering tasks like
SQuAD (a linear layer on top of the hidden-states output to compute `span start logits` and `span end logits`).

This model inherits from [PreTrainedModel](/docs/transformers/main/en/main_classes/model#transformers.PreTrainedModel). Check the superclass documentation for the generic methods the
library implements for all its model (such as downloading or saving, resizing the input embeddings, pruning heads
etc.)

This model is also a PyTorch [torch.nn.Module](https://pytorch.org/docs/stable/nn.html#torch.nn.Module) subclass.
Use it as a regular PyTorch Module and refer to the PyTorch documentation for all matter related to general usage
and behavior.

  Indices of input sequence tokens in the vocabulary. Padding will be ignored by default.

  Indices can be obtained using [AutoTokenizer](/docs/transformers/main/en/model_doc/auto#transformers.AutoTokenizer). See [PreTrainedTokenizer.encode()](/docs/transformers/main/en/internal/tokenization_utils#transformers.PreTrainedTokenizerBase.encode) and

  [What are input IDs?](../glossary#input-ids)
- **attention_mask** (`torch.Tensor` of shape `(batch_size, sequence_length)`, *optional*) --
  Mask to avoid performing attention on padding token indices. Mask values selected in `[0, 1]`:

  - 1 for tokens that are **not masked**,
  - 0 for tokens that are **masked**.

  [What are attention masks?](../glossary#attention-mask)
- **decoder_input_ids** (`torch.LongTensor` of shape `(batch_size, target_sequence_length)`, *optional*) --
  Provide for translation and summarization training. By default, the model will create this tensor by
  shifting the `input_ids` to the right, following the paper.
- **decoder_attention_mask** (`torch.LongTensor` of shape `(batch_size, target_sequence_length)`, *optional*) --
  Default behavior: generate a tensor that ignores pad tokens in `decoder_input_ids`. Causal mask will also
  be used by default.

  If you want to change padding behavior, you should read
  `modeling_bigbird_pegasus._prepare_decoder_attention_mask` and modify to your needs. See diagram 1 in

  are not taken into account for computing the loss.
- **inputs_embeds** (`torch.FloatTensor` of shape `(batch_size, sequence_length, hidden_size)`, *optional*) --
  Optionally, instead of passing `input_ids` you can choose to directly pass an embedded representation. This

  model's internal embedding lookup matrix.
- **decoder_inputs_embeds** (`torch.FloatTensor` of shape `(batch_size, target_sequence_length, hidden_size)`, *optional*) --
  Optionally, instead of passing `decoder_input_ids` you can choose to directly pass an embedded
  representation. If `past_key_values` is used, optionally only the last `decoder_inputs_embeds` have to be
  input (see `past_key_values`). This is useful if you want more control over how to convert
  `decoder_input_ids` indices into associated vectors than the model's internal embedding lookup matrix.

  this tensor is not affected by padding. It is used to update the cache in the correct position and to infer

The [BigBirdPegasusForQuestionAnswering](/docs/transformers/main/en/model_doc/bigbird_pegasus#transformers.BigBirdPegasusForQuestionAnswering) forward method, overrides the `__call__` special method.

Although the recipe for forward pass needs to be defined within this function, one should call the `Module`
instance afterwards instead of this since the former takes care of running the pre and post processing steps while
the latter silently ignores them.

Example:

```python
>>> from transformers import AutoTokenizer, BigBirdPegasusForQuestionAnswering
>>> import torch

>>> tokenizer = AutoTokenizer.from_pretrained("google/bigbird-pegasus-large-arxiv")
>>> model = BigBirdPegasusForQuestionAnswering.from_pretrained("google/bigbird-pegasus-large-arxiv")

>>> question, text = "Who was Jim Henson?", "Jim Henson was a nice puppet"

  If an `int`, compute logits for the last `logits_to_keep` tokens. If `0`, calculate logits for all
  `input_ids` (special case). Only last token logits are needed for generation, and calculating them only for that
  token can save memory, which becomes pretty significant for long sequences or large vocabulary size.
  If a `torch.Tensor`, must be 1D corresponding to the indices to keep in the sequence length dimension.
  This is useful when using packed tensor format (single dimension for batch and sequence length).0[transformers.modeling_outputs.CausalLMOutputWithCrossAttentions](/docs/transformers/main/en/main_classes/output#transformers.modeling_outputs.CausalLMOutputWithCrossAttentions) or `tuple(torch.FloatTensor)`A [transformers.modeling_outputs.CausalLMOutputWithCrossAttentions](/docs/transformers/main/en/main_classes/output#transformers.modeling_outputs.CausalLMOutputWithCrossAttentions) or a tuple of

  Contains pre-computed hidden-states (key and values in the attention blocks) that can be used (see
  `past_key_values` input) to speed up sequential decoding.
The [BigBirdPegasusForCausalLM](/docs/transformers/main/en/model_doc/bigbird_pegasus#transformers.BigBirdPegasusForCausalLM) forward method, overrides the `__call__` special method.

Although the recipe for forward pass needs to be defined within this function, one should call the `Module`
instance afterwards instead of this since the former takes care of running the pre and post processing steps while
the latter silently ignores them.

Example:

```python
>>> from transformers import AutoTokenizer, BigBirdPegasusForCausalLM

>>> tokenizer = AutoTokenizer.from_pretrained("google/bigbird-pegasus-large-arxiv")
>>> model = BigBirdPegasusForCausalLM.from_pretrained(
...     "google/bigbird-pegasus-large-arxiv", add_cross_attention=False
... )
>>> assert model.config.is_decoder, f"{model.__class__} has to be configured as a decoder."
>>> inputs = tokenizer("Hello, my dog is cute", return_tensors="pt")
>>> outputs = model(**inputs)

>>> logits = outputs.logits
```

**Parameters:**

input_ids (`torch.LongTensor` of shape `(batch_size, sequence_length)`, *optional*) : Indices of input sequence tokens in the vocabulary. Padding will be ignored by default.  Indices can be obtained using [AutoTokenizer](/docs/transformers/main/en/model_doc/auto#transformers.AutoTokenizer). See [PreTrainedTokenizer.encode()](/docs/transformers/main/en/internal/tokenization_utils#transformers.PreTrainedTokenizerBase.encode) and [PreTrainedTokenizer.__call__()](/docs/transformers/main/en/internal/tokenization_utils#transformers.PreTrainedTokenizerBase.__call__) for details.  [What are input IDs?](../glossary#input-ids)

attention_mask (`torch.Tensor` of shape `(batch_size, sequence_length)`, *optional*) : Mask to avoid performing attention on padding token indices. Mask values selected in `[0, 1]`:  - 1 for tokens that are **not masked**, - 0 for tokens that are **masked**.  [What are attention masks?](../glossary#attention-mask)

encoder_hidden_states (`torch.FloatTensor` of shape `(batch_size, sequence_length, hidden_size)`, *optional*) : Sequence of hidden-states at the output of the last layer of the encoder. Used in the cross-attention if the model is configured as a decoder.

encoder_attention_mask (`torch.FloatTensor` of shape `(batch_size, sequence_length)`, *optional*) : Mask to avoid performing attention on the padding token indices of the encoder input. This mask is used in the cross-attention if the model is configured as a decoder. Mask values selected in `[0, 1]`:  - 1 for tokens that are **not masked**, - 0 for tokens that are **masked**.

past_key_values (`~cache_utils.Cache`, *optional*) : Pre-computed hidden-states (key and values in the self-attention blocks and in the cross-attention blocks) that can be used to speed up sequential decoding. This typically consists in the `past_key_values` returned by the model at a previous stage of decoding, when `use_cache=True` or `config.use_cache=True`.  Only [Cache](/docs/transformers/main/en/internal/generation_utils#transformers.Cache) instance is allowed as input, see our [kv cache guide](https://huggingface.co/docs/transformers/en/kv_cache). If no `past_key_values` are passed, [DynamicCache](/docs/transformers/main/en/internal/generation_utils#transformers.DynamicCache) will be initialized by default.  The model will output the same cache format that is fed as input.  If `past_key_values` are used, the user is expected to input only unprocessed `input_ids` (those that don't have their past key value states given to this model) of shape `(batch_size, unprocessed_length)` instead of all `input_ids` of shape `(batch_size, sequence_length)`.

inputs_embeds (`torch.FloatTensor` of shape `(batch_size, sequence_length, hidden_size)`, *optional*) : Optionally, instead of passing `input_ids` you can choose to directly pass an embedded representation. This is useful if you want more control over how to convert `input_ids` indices into associated vectors than the model's internal embedding lookup matrix.

labels (`torch.LongTensor` of shape `(batch_size, sequence_length)`, *optional*) : Labels for computing the masked language modeling loss. Indices should either be in `[0, ..., config.vocab_size]` or -100 (see `input_ids` docstring). Tokens with indices set to `-100` are ignored (masked), the loss is only computed for the tokens with labels in `[0, ..., config.vocab_size]`.

use_cache (`bool`, *optional*) : If set to `True`, `past_key_values` key value states are returned and can be used to speed up decoding (see `past_key_values`).

output_attentions (`bool`, *optional*) : Whether or not to return the attentions tensors of all attention layers. See `attentions` under returned tensors for more detail.

output_hidden_states (`bool`, *optional*) : Whether or not to return the hidden states of all layers. See `hidden_states` under returned tensors for more detail.

return_dict (`bool`, *optional*) : Whether or not to return a [ModelOutput](/docs/transformers/main/en/main_classes/output#transformers.utils.ModelOutput) instead of a plain tuple.

cache_position (`torch.LongTensor` of shape `(sequence_length)`, *optional*) : Indices depicting the position of the input sequence tokens in the sequence. Contrarily to `position_ids`, this tensor is not affected by padding. It is used to update the cache in the correct position and to infer the complete sequence length.

logits_to_keep (`Union[int, torch.Tensor]`, defaults to `0`) : If an `int`, compute logits for the last `logits_to_keep` tokens. If `0`, calculate logits for all `input_ids` (special case). Only last token logits are needed for generation, and calculating them only for that token can save memory, which becomes pretty significant for long sequences or large vocabulary size. If a `torch.Tensor`, must be 1D corresponding to the indices to keep in the sequence length dimension. This is useful when using packed tensor format (single dimension for batch and sequence length).
