## Overview

The MEGA model was proposed in [Mega: Moving Average Equipped Gated Attention](https://huggingface.co/papers/2209.10655) by Xuezhe Ma, Chunting Zhou, Xiang Kong, Junxian He, Liangke Gui, Graham Neubig, Jonathan May, and Luke Zettlemoyer.
MEGA proposes a new approach to self-attention with each encoder layer having a multi-headed exponential moving average in addition to a single head of standard dot-product attention, giving the attention mechanism
stronger positional biases. This allows MEGA to perform competitively to Transformers on standard benchmarks including LRA
while also having significantly fewer parameters. MEGA's compute efficiency allows it to scale to very long sequences, making it an
attractive option for long-document NLP tasks.

The abstract from the paper is the following:

 *The design choices in the Transformer attention mechanism, including weak inductive bias and quadratic computational complexity, have limited its application for modeling long sequences. In this paper, we introduce Mega, a simple, theoretically grounded, single-head gated attention mechanism equipped with (exponential) moving average to incorporate inductive bias of position-aware local dependencies into the position-agnostic attention mechanism. We further propose a variant of Mega that offers linear time and space complexity yet yields only minimal quality loss, by efficiently splitting the whole sequence into multiple chunks with fixed length. Extensive experiments on a wide range of sequence modeling benchmarks, including the Long Range Arena, neural machine translation, auto-regressive language modeling, and image and speech classification, show that Mega achieves significant improvements over other sequence models, including variants of Transformers and recent state space models.*

This model was contributed by [mnaylor](https://huggingface.co/mnaylor).

## Usage tips

- MEGA can perform quite well with relatively few parameters. See Appendix D in the MEGA paper for examples of architectural specs which perform well in various settings. If using MEGA as a decoder, be sure to set `bidirectional=False` to avoid errors with default bidirectional.
- Mega-chunk is a variant of mega that reduces time and spaces complexity from quadratic to linear. Utilize chunking with MegaConfig.use_chunking and control chunk size with MegaConfig.chunk_size

## Implementation Notes

- The original implementation of MEGA had an inconsistent expectation of attention masks for padding and causal self-attention between the softmax attention and Laplace/squared ReLU method. This implementation addresses that inconsistency.
- The original implementation did not include token type embeddings; this implementation adds support for these, with the option controlled by MegaConfig.add_token_type_embeddings

This is the configuration class to store the configuration of a [MegaModel](/docs/transformers/main/en/model_doc/mega#transformers.MegaModel). It is used to instantiate a Mega
model according to the specified arguments, defining the model architecture. Instantiating a configuration with the
defaults will yield a similar configuration to that of the Mega
[mnaylor/mega-base-wikitext](https://huggingface.co/mnaylor/mega-base-wikitext) architecture.

Configuration objects inherit from [PreTrainedConfig](/docs/transformers/main/en/main_classes/configuration#transformers.PreTrainedConfig) and can be used to control the model outputs. Read the
documentation from [PreTrainedConfig](/docs/transformers/main/en/main_classes/configuration#transformers.PreTrainedConfig) for more information.

Examples:

```python
>>> from transformers import MegaConfig, MegaModel

>>> # Initializing a Mega configuration
>>> configuration = MegaConfig()

>>> # Initializing a model (with random weights) from the configuration
>>> model = MegaModel(configuration)

>>> # Accessing the model configuration
>>> configuration = model.config
```

**Parameters:**

vocab_size (`int`, *optional*, defaults to 30522) : Vocabulary size of the Mega model. Defines the number of different tokens that can be represented by the `inputs_ids` passed when calling [MegaModel](/docs/transformers/main/en/model_doc/mega#transformers.MegaModel).

use_feature_dropout (`bool`, *optional*, defaults to `False`) : Whether to use feature-based (`True`) or standard dropout (`False`)

use_normalized_ffn (`bool`, *optional*, defaults to `True`) : Whether to use the normalized feed-forward sub-layer in Mega blocks (`True`) or pass Mega encoder output as-is (`False`)

nffn_hidden_size (`int`, *optional*, defaults to 256) : If using the normalized feed-forward network (NFFN) layer within Mega (`use_normalized_ffn = True`), this is the hidden size of the NFFN

normalize_before_ffn (`bool`, *optional*, defaults to `True`) : Whether to normalize before (`True`) or after (`False`) the feed-forward portion of NFFN

nffn_activation_dropout_prob (`float`, *optional*, defaults to 0.1) : The dropout ratio for the NFFN component.

max_positions (`int`, *optional*, defaults to 2048) : The maximum sequence length to use for positional representations. For `"simple"` relative positional bias, this is a hard limit on input length; `"rotary"` relative positional bias will extrapolate to longer sequences

add_token_type_embeddings (`bool`, *optional*, defaults to `True`) : Whether to account for token types in embeddings. Left as optional to maintain compatibility with original implementation while adding support for token types.

type_vocab_size (`int`, *optional*, defaults to 2) : The vocabulary size of the `token_type_ids` passed when calling [MegaModel](/docs/transformers/main/en/model_doc/mega#transformers.MegaModel). Only used if `add_token_type_embeddings = True`

initializer_range (`float`, *optional*, defaults to 0.02) : The standard deviation of the truncated_normal_initializer for initializing all weight matrices.

ema_delta_alpha_range (`float`, *optional*, defaults to 0.2) : The standard deviation for initializing the delta (damping factor) and alpha (decay factor) parameters in MegaMultiDimensionDampedEma.

ema_gamma_omega_range (`float`, *optional*, defaults to 1.0) : The standard deviation for initializing the gamma (projection matrix) and omega (residual weight) parameters in MultiDimensionEMA.

relative_positional_bias (`str`, *optional*, defaults to `"rotary"`) : Type of relative positional encoding. Choose one of `"rotary"` or `"simple"`. If `"simple"` is selected, `max_positions` is used as a limit on input size, while `"rotary"` extrapolates beyond `max_positions`.

is_decoder (`bool`, *optional*, defaults to `False`) : Whether the model is used as a decoder or not. If `False`, the model is used as an encoder.

add_lm_hidden_dense_layer (`bool`, *optional*, defaults to `True`) : Whether to include a hidden layer for projection between encoder outputs and LM heads (`True`) or pass hidden states directly to LM head (`False`). Remains optional for compatibility with original implementation

## MegaModel[[transformers.MegaModel]]

#### transformers.MegaModel[[transformers.MegaModel]]

[Source](https://github.com/huggingface/transformers/blob/main/src/transformers/models/deprecated/mega/modeling_mega.py#L1447)

The bare MEGA Model transformer outputting raw hidden-states without any specific head on top.

This model inherits from [PreTrainedModel](/docs/transformers/main/en/main_classes/model#transformers.PreTrainedModel). Check the superclass documentation for the generic methods the
library implements for all its model (such as downloading or saving, resizing the input embeddings, pruning heads
etc.)

This model is also a PyTorch [torch.nn.Module](https://pytorch.org/docs/stable/nn.html#torch.nn.Module) subclass.
Use it as a regular PyTorch Module and refer to the PyTorch documentation for all matter related to general usage
and behavior.

The model can behave as an encoder (with only self-attention) as well as a decoder, in which case a layer of
cross-attention is added after self-attention, following the architecture described in *Mega: Moving Average
Equipped Gated Attention*_ by Xuezhe Ma, Chunting Zhou, Xiang Kong, Junxian He, Liangke Gui, Graham Neubig,
Jonathan May, and Luke Zettlemoyer

To behave as a decoder the model needs to be initialized with the `is_decoder` argument of the configuration set to
`True` and `bidirectional` set to `False`. To be used in a Seq2Seq model, the model needs to initialized with both
`is_decoder=True` and `bidirectional=False` argument as well as `add_cross_attention` set to `True`; an
`encoder_hidden_states` is then expected as an input to the forward pass.

MEGA Model with a `language modeling` head on top.

This model inherits from [PreTrainedModel](/docs/transformers/main/en/main_classes/model#transformers.PreTrainedModel). Check the superclass documentation for the generic methods the
library implements for all its model (such as downloading or saving, resizing the input embeddings, pruning heads

This model is also a PyTorch [torch.nn.Module](https://pytorch.org/docs/stable/nn.html#torch.nn.Module) subclass.
Use it as a regular PyTorch Module and refer to the PyTorch documentation for all matter related to general usage
and behavior.

instance afterwards instead of this since the former takes care of running the pre and post processing steps while
the latter silently ignores them.

instance afterwards instead of this since the former takes care of running the pre and post processing steps while
the latter silently ignores them.

>>> with torch.no_grad():
...     logits = model(**inputs).logits

>>> predicted_token_class_ids = logits.argmax(-1)

>>> # Note that tokens are classified rather then input words which means that
>>> # there might be more predicted token classes than words.
>>> # Multiple token classes might account for the same word
>>> predicted_tokens_classes = [model.config.id2label[t.item()] for t in predicted_token_class_ids[0]]

>>> labels = predicted_token_class_ids

```

**Parameters:**

MEGA Model with a span classification head on top for extractive question-answering tasks like SQuAD (a linear
layers on top of the hidden-states output to compute `span start logits` and `span end logits`).

This model inherits from [PreTrainedModel](/docs/transformers/main/en/main_classes/model#transformers.PreTrainedModel). Check the superclass documentation for the generic methods the
library implements for all its model (such as downloading or saving, resizing the input embeddings, pruning heads
etc.)

This model is also a PyTorch [torch.nn.Module](https://pytorch.org/docs/stable/nn.html#torch.nn.Module) subclass.
