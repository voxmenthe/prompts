# PEGASUS-X

[PEGASUS-X](https://huggingface.co/papers/2208.04347) is an encoder-decoder (sequence-to-sequence) transformer model for long-input summarization. It extends the [Pegasus](./pegasus) model with staggered block-local attention, global encoder tokens, and additional pretraining on long text sequences, enabling it to handle inputs of up to 16,000 tokens. PEGASUS-X matches the performance of much larger models while using fewer parameters.

You can find all the original PEGASUS-X checkpoints under the [Google](https://huggingface.co/google/models?search=pegasus-x) organization.

In the presence of light, plants absorb carbon dioxide from the atmosphere through small pores in their leaves called stomata, and take in water from the soil through their root systems.
These ingredients are then transformed into glucose, a type of sugar that serves as a source of chemical energy, and oxygen, which is released as a byproduct into the atmosphere.

This is the configuration class to store the configuration of a [PegasusXModel](/docs/transformers/main/en/model_doc/pegasus_x#transformers.PegasusXModel). It is used to instantiate a
PEGASUS-X model according to the specified arguments, defining the model architecture. Instantiating a
configuration with the defaults will yield a similar configuration to that of the PEGASUS-X

This model inherits from [PreTrainedModel](/docs/transformers/main/en/main_classes/model#transformers.PreTrainedModel). Check the superclass documentation for the generic methods the
library implements for all its model (such as downloading or saving, resizing the input embeddings, pruning heads
etc.)

This model is also a PyTorch [torch.nn.Module](https://pytorch.org/docs/stable/nn.html#torch.nn.Module) subclass.
Use it as a regular PyTorch Module and refer to the PyTorch documentation for all matter related to general usage
and behavior.

  Indices of input sequence tokens in the vocabulary. Padding will be ignored by default.

  Indices can be obtained using [AutoTokenizer](/docs/transformers/main/en/model_doc/auto#transformers.AutoTokenizer). See [PreTrainedTokenizer.encode()](/docs/transformers/main/en/internal/tokenization_utils#transformers.PreTrainedTokenizerBase.encode) and
  [PreTrainedTokenizer.__call__()](/docs/transformers/main/en/internal/tokenization_utils#transformers.PreTrainedTokenizerBase.__call__) for details.

  [What are input IDs?](../glossary#input-ids)
- **attention_mask** (`torch.Tensor` of shape `(batch_size, sequence_length)`, *optional*) --
  Mask to avoid performing attention on padding token indices. Mask values selected in `[0, 1]`:

  - 1 for tokens that are **not masked**,
  - 0 for tokens that are **masked**.

  [What are attention masks?](../glossary#attention-mask)
- **decoder_input_ids** (`torch.LongTensor` of shape `(batch_size, target_sequence_length)`, *optional*) --
  Indices of decoder input sequence tokens in the vocabulary.

  Indices can be obtained using [AutoTokenizer](/docs/transformers/main/en/model_doc/auto#transformers.AutoTokenizer). See [PreTrainedTokenizer.encode()](/docs/transformers/main/en/internal/tokenization_utils#transformers.PreTrainedTokenizerBase.encode) and
  [PreTrainedTokenizer.__call__()](/docs/transformers/main/en/internal/tokenization_utils#transformers.PreTrainedTokenizerBase.__call__) for details.

  [What are decoder input IDs?](../glossary#decoder-input-ids)

  PEGASUS-X uses the `pad_token_id` as the starting token for `decoder_input_ids` generation. If
  `past_key_values` is used, optionally only the last `decoder_input_ids` have to be input (see
  `past_key_values`).
- **decoder_attention_mask** (`torch.LongTensor` of shape `(batch_size, target_sequence_length)`, *optional*) --
  Default behavior: generate a tensor that ignores pad tokens in `decoder_input_ids`. Causal mask will also
  be used by default.
- **encoder_outputs** (`tuple[torch.FloatTensor]`, *optional*) --
  Tuple consists of (`last_hidden_state`, *optional*: `hidden_states`, *optional*: `attentions`)
  `last_hidden_state` of shape `(batch_size, sequence_length, hidden_size)`, *optional*) is a sequence of
  hidden-states at the output of the last layer of the encoder. Used in the cross-attention of the decoder.
- **past_key_values** (`~cache_utils.Cache`, *optional*) --
  Pre-computed hidden-states (key and values in the self-attention blocks and in the cross-attention
  blocks) that can be used to speed up sequential decoding. This typically consists in the `past_key_values`
  returned by the model at a previous stage of decoding, when `use_cache=True` or `config.use_cache=True`.

  Only [Cache](/docs/transformers/main/en/internal/generation_utils#transformers.Cache) instance is allowed as input, see our [kv cache guide](https://huggingface.co/docs/transformers/en/kv_cache).
  If no `past_key_values` are passed, [DynamicCache](/docs/transformers/main/en/internal/generation_utils#transformers.DynamicCache) will be initialized by default.

  The model will output the same cache format that is fed as input.

  If `past_key_values` are used, the user is expected to input only unprocessed `input_ids` (those that don't
  have their past key value states given to this model) of shape `(batch_size, unprocessed_length)` instead of all `input_ids`
  of shape `(batch_size, sequence_length)`.
- **inputs_embeds** (`torch.Tensor` of shape `(batch_size, sequence_length, hidden_size)`, *optional*) --
  Optionally, instead of passing `input_ids` you can choose to directly pass an embedded representation. This
  is useful if you want more control over how to convert `input_ids` indices into associated vectors than the
  model's internal embedding lookup matrix.
- **decoder_inputs_embeds** (`torch.Tensor` of shape `(batch_size, target_sequence_length, hidden_size)`, *optional*) --
  Optionally, instead of passing `decoder_input_ids` you can choose to directly pass an embedded
  representation. If `past_key_values` is used, optionally only the last `decoder_inputs_embeds` have to be
  input (see `past_key_values`). This is useful if you want more control over how to convert
  `decoder_input_ids` indices into associated vectors than the model's internal embedding lookup matrix.

  If `decoder_input_ids` and `decoder_inputs_embeds` are both unset, `decoder_inputs_embeds` takes the value
  of `inputs_embeds`.
- **use_cache** (`bool`, *optional*) --
  If set to `True`, `past_key_values` key value states are returned and can be used to speed up decoding (see
  `past_key_values`).
- **output_attentions** (`bool`, *optional*) --
  Whether or not to return the attentions tensors of all attention layers. See `attentions` under returned
  tensors for more detail.
- **output_hidden_states** (`bool`, *optional*) --
  Whether or not to return the hidden states of all layers. See `hidden_states` under returned tensors for
  more detail.
- **return_dict** (`bool`, *optional*) --
  Whether or not to return a [ModelOutput](/docs/transformers/main/en/main_classes/output#transformers.utils.ModelOutput) instead of a plain tuple.
- **cache_position** (`torch.Tensor` of shape `(sequence_length)`, *optional*) --
  Indices depicting the position of the input sequence tokens in the sequence. Contrarily to `position_ids`,
  this tensor is not affected by padding. It is used to update the cache in the correct position and to infer
  the complete sequence length.0[transformers.modeling_outputs.Seq2SeqModelOutput](/docs/transformers/main/en/main_classes/output#transformers.modeling_outputs.Seq2SeqModelOutput) or `tuple(torch.FloatTensor)`A [transformers.modeling_outputs.Seq2SeqModelOutput](/docs/transformers/main/en/main_classes/output#transformers.modeling_outputs.Seq2SeqModelOutput) or a tuple of

- **last_hidden_state** (`torch.FloatTensor` of shape `(batch_size, sequence_length, hidden_size)`) -- Sequence of hidden-states at the output of the last layer of the decoder of the model.

  If `past_key_values` is used only the last hidden-state of the sequences of shape `(batch_size, 1,
  hidden_size)` is output.
- **past_key_values** (`EncoderDecoderCache`, *optional*, returned when `use_cache=True` is passed or when `config.use_cache=True`) -- It is a [EncoderDecoderCache](/docs/transformers/main/en/internal/generation_utils#transformers.EncoderDecoderCache) instance. For more details, see our [kv cache guide](https://huggingface.co/docs/transformers/en/kv_cache).

  Attentions weights of the decoder, after the attention softmax, used to compute the weighted average in the

The [PegasusXModel](/docs/transformers/main/en/model_doc/pegasus_x#transformers.PegasusXModel) forward method, overrides the `__call__` special method.

Although the recipe for forward pass needs to be defined within this function, one should call the `Module`
instance afterwards instead of this since the former takes care of running the pre and post processing steps while
the latter silently ignores them.

Example:

```python
>>> from transformers import AutoTokenizer, PegasusModel

>>> tokenizer = AutoTokenizer.from_pretrained("google/pegasus-x-large")
>>> model = PegasusModel.from_pretrained("google/pegasus-x-large")

>>> inputs = tokenizer("Studies have been shown that owning a dog is good for you", return_tensors="pt")
>>> decoder_inputs = tokenizer("Studies show that", return_tensors="pt")
>>> outputs = model(input_ids=inputs.input_ids, decoder_input_ids=decoder_inputs.input_ids)

>>> last_hidden_states = outputs.last_hidden_state
>>> list(last_hidden_states.shape)
[1, 4, 1024]
```

**Parameters:**

  Indices of input sequence tokens in the vocabulary. Padding will be ignored by default.

  Indices can be obtained using [AutoTokenizer](/docs/transformers/main/en/model_doc/auto#transformers.AutoTokenizer). See [PreTrainedTokenizer.encode()](/docs/transformers/main/en/internal/tokenization_utils#transformers.PreTrainedTokenizerBase.encode) and

  [What are input IDs?](../glossary#input-ids)
- **attention_mask** (`torch.Tensor` of shape `(batch_size, sequence_length)`, *optional*) --
  Mask to avoid performing attention on padding token indices. Mask values selected in `[0, 1]`:

  - 1 for tokens that are **not masked**,
  - 0 for tokens that are **masked**.

  [What are attention masks?](../glossary#attention-mask)
- **decoder_input_ids** (`torch.LongTensor` of shape `(batch_size, target_sequence_length)`, *optional*) --
  Indices of decoder input sequence tokens in the vocabulary.

  Indices can be obtained using [AutoTokenizer](/docs/transformers/main/en/model_doc/auto#transformers.AutoTokenizer). See [PreTrainedTokenizer.encode()](/docs/transformers/main/en/internal/tokenization_utils#transformers.PreTrainedTokenizerBase.encode) and

  [What are decoder input IDs?](../glossary#decoder-input-ids)

  PEGASUS-X uses the `pad_token_id` as the starting token for `decoder_input_ids` generation. If
  `past_key_values` is used, optionally only the last `decoder_input_ids` have to be input (see
  `past_key_values`).
- **decoder_attention_mask** (`torch.LongTensor` of shape `(batch_size, target_sequence_length)`, *optional*) --
  Default behavior: generate a tensor that ignores pad tokens in `decoder_input_ids`. Causal mask will also
  be used by default.
- **encoder_outputs** (`tuple[torch.FloatTensor]`, *optional*) --
  Tuple consists of (`last_hidden_state`, *optional*: `hidden_states`, *optional*: `attentions`)
  `last_hidden_state` of shape `(batch_size, sequence_length, hidden_size)`, *optional*) is a sequence of
  hidden-states at the output of the last layer of the encoder. Used in the cross-attention of the decoder.
- **past_key_values** (`~cache_utils.Cache`, *optional*) --
  Pre-computed hidden-states (key and values in the self-attention blocks and in the cross-attention
  blocks) that can be used to speed up sequential decoding. This typically consists in the `past_key_values`
  returned by the model at a previous stage of decoding, when `use_cache=True` or `config.use_cache=True`.

  Only [Cache](/docs/transformers/main/en/internal/generation_utils#transformers.Cache) instance is allowed as input, see our [kv cache guide](https://huggingface.co/docs/transformers/en/kv_cache).
  If no `past_key_values` are passed, [DynamicCache](/docs/transformers/main/en/internal/generation_utils#transformers.DynamicCache) will be initialized by default.

  The model will output the same cache format that is fed as input.

  If `past_key_values` are used, the user is expected to input only unprocessed `input_ids` (those that don't
  have their past key value states given to this model) of shape `(batch_size, unprocessed_length)` instead of all `input_ids`
  of shape `(batch_size, sequence_length)`.
- **inputs_embeds** (`torch.Tensor` of shape `(batch_size, sequence_length, hidden_size)`, *optional*) --
  Optionally, instead of passing `input_ids` you can choose to directly pass an embedded representation. This
  is useful if you want more control over how to convert `input_ids` indices into associated vectors than the
  model's internal embedding lookup matrix.
- **decoder_inputs_embeds** (`torch.Tensor` of shape `(batch_size, target_sequence_length, hidden_size)`, *optional*) --
  Optionally, instead of passing `decoder_input_ids` you can choose to directly pass an embedded
  representation. If `past_key_values` is used, optionally only the last `decoder_inputs_embeds` have to be
  input (see `past_key_values`). This is useful if you want more control over how to convert
  `decoder_input_ids` indices into associated vectors than the model's internal embedding lookup matrix.

  If `decoder_input_ids` and `decoder_inputs_embeds` are both unset, `decoder_inputs_embeds` takes the value
  of `inputs_embeds`.
- **labels** (`torch.LongTensor` of shape `(batch_size, sequence_length)`, *optional*) --
  Labels for computing the masked language modeling loss. Indices should either be in `[0, ...,
  config.vocab_size]` or -100 (see `input_ids` docstring). Tokens with indices set to `-100` are ignored
  (masked), the loss is only computed for the tokens with labels in `[0, ..., config.vocab_size]`.
- **use_cache** (`bool`, *optional*) --
  If set to `True`, `past_key_values` key value states are returned and can be used to speed up decoding (see
  `past_key_values`).
- **output_attentions** (`bool`, *optional*) --
  Whether or not to return the attentions tensors of all attention layers. See `attentions` under returned
  tensors for more detail.
- **output_hidden_states** (`bool`, *optional*) --
  Whether or not to return the hidden states of all layers. See `hidden_states` under returned tensors for
  more detail.
- **return_dict** (`bool`, *optional*) --
  Whether or not to return a [ModelOutput](/docs/transformers/main/en/main_classes/output#transformers.utils.ModelOutput) instead of a plain tuple.
- **cache_position** (`torch.Tensor` of shape `(sequence_length)`, *optional*) --
  Indices depicting the position of the input sequence tokens in the sequence. Contrarily to `position_ids`,
  this tensor is not affected by padding. It is used to update the cache in the correct position and to infer
  the complete sequence length.0[transformers.modeling_outputs.Seq2SeqLMOutput](/docs/transformers/main/en/main_classes/output#transformers.modeling_outputs.Seq2SeqLMOutput) or `tuple(torch.FloatTensor)`A [transformers.modeling_outputs.Seq2SeqLMOutput](/docs/transformers/main/en/main_classes/output#transformers.modeling_outputs.Seq2SeqLMOutput) or a tuple of

- **logits** (`torch.FloatTensor` of shape `(batch_size, sequence_length, config.vocab_size)`) -- Prediction scores of the language modeling head (scores for each vocabulary token before SoftMax).

The [PegasusXForConditionalGeneration](/docs/transformers/main/en/model_doc/pegasus_x#transformers.PegasusXForConditionalGeneration) forward method, overrides the `__call__` special method.

Although the recipe for forward pass needs to be defined within this function, one should call the `Module`
instance afterwards instead of this since the former takes care of running the pre and post processing steps while
the latter silently ignores them.

Example:

```python
```

**Parameters:**

config ([PegasusXConfig](/docs/transformers/main/en/model_doc/pegasus_x#transformers.PegasusXConfig)) : Model configuration class with all the parameters of the model.
