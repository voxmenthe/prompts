# MusicGen

## Overview

The MusicGen model was proposed in the paper [Simple and Controllable Music Generation](https://huggingface.co/papers/2306.05284)
by Jade Copet, Felix Kreuk, Itai Gat, Tal Remez, David Kant, Gabriel Synnaeve, Yossi Adi and Alexandre Défossez.

MusicGen is a single stage auto-regressive Transformer model capable of generating high-quality music samples conditioned
on text descriptions or audio prompts. The text descriptions are passed through a frozen text encoder model to obtain a
sequence of hidden-state representations. MusicGen is then trained to predict discrete audio tokens, or *audio codes*,
conditioned on these hidden-states. These audio tokens are then decoded using an audio compression model, such as EnCodec,
to recover the audio waveform.

Through an efficient token interleaving pattern, MusicGen does not require a self-supervised semantic representation of
the text/audio prompts, thus eliminating the need to cascade multiple models to predict a set of codebooks (e.g.
hierarchically or upsampling). Instead, it is able to generate all the codebooks in a single forward pass.

The abstract from the paper is the following:

*We tackle the task of conditional music generation. We introduce MusicGen, a single Language Model (LM) that operates
over several streams of compressed discrete music representation, i.e., tokens. Unlike prior work, MusicGen is comprised
of a single-stage transformer LM together with efficient token interleaving patterns, which eliminates the need for
cascading several models, e.g., hierarchically or upsampling. Following this approach, we demonstrate how MusicGen
can generate high-quality samples, while being conditioned on textual description or melodic features, allowing better
controls over the generated output. We conduct extensive empirical evaluation, considering both automatic and human
studies, showing the proposed approach is superior to the evaluated baselines on a standard text-to-music benchmark.
Through ablation studies, we shed light over the importance of each of the components comprising MusicGen.*

This model was contributed by [sanchit-gandhi](https://huggingface.co/sanchit-gandhi). The original code can be found
[here](https://github.com/facebookresearch/audiocraft). The pre-trained checkpoints can be found on the
[Hugging Face Hub](https://huggingface.co/models?sort=downloads&search=facebook%2Fmusicgen-).

## Usage tips

- After downloading the original checkpoints from [here](https://github.com/facebookresearch/audiocraft/blob/main/docs/MUSICGEN.md#importing--exporting-models) , you can convert them using the **conversion script** available at
`src/transformers/models/musicgen/convert_musicgen_transformers.py` with the following command:

```bash
python src/transformers/models/musicgen/convert_musicgen_transformers.py \
    --checkpoint small --pytorch_dump_folder /output/path
```

## Generation

MusicGen is compatible with two generation modes: greedy and sampling. In practice, sampling leads to significantly
better results than greedy, thus we encourage sampling mode to be used where possible. Sampling is enabled by default,
and can be explicitly specified by setting `do_sample=True` in the call to `MusicgenForConditionalGeneration.generate()`,
or by overriding the model's generation config (see below).

Generation is limited by the sinusoidal positional embeddings to 30 second inputs. Meaning, MusicGen cannot generate more
than 30 seconds of audio (1503 tokens), and input audio passed by Audio-Prompted Generation contributes to this limit so,
given an input of 20 seconds of audio, MusicGen cannot generate more than 10 seconds of additional audio.

Transformers supports both mono (1-channel) and stereo (2-channel) variants of MusicGen. The mono channel versions
generate a single set of codebooks. The stereo versions generate 2 sets of codebooks, 1 for each channel (left/right),
and each set of codebooks is decoded independently through the audio compression model. The audio streams for each
channel are combined to give the final stereo output.

### Unconditional Generation

The inputs for unconditional (or 'null') generation can be obtained through the method
`MusicgenForConditionalGeneration.get_unconditional_inputs()`:

```python
>>> from transformers import MusicgenForConditionalGeneration

>>> model = MusicgenForConditionalGeneration.from_pretrained("facebook/musicgen-small")
>>> unconditional_inputs = model.get_unconditional_inputs(num_samples=1)

>>> audio_values = model.generate(**unconditional_inputs, do_sample=True, max_new_tokens=256)
```

The audio outputs are a three-dimensional Torch tensor of shape `(batch_size, num_channels, sequence_length)`. To listen
to the generated audio samples, you can either play them in an ipynb notebook:

```python
from IPython.display import Audio

sampling_rate = model.config.audio_encoder.sampling_rate
Audio(audio_values[0].numpy(), rate=sampling_rate)
```

Or save them as a `.wav` file using a third-party library, e.g. `scipy`:

```python
>>> import scipy

>>> sampling_rate = model.config.audio_encoder.sampling_rate
>>> scipy.io.wavfile.write("musicgen_out.wav", rate=sampling_rate, data=audio_values[0, 0].numpy())
```

### Text-Conditional Generation

The model can generate an audio sample conditioned on a text prompt through use of the [MusicgenProcessor](/docs/transformers/main/en/model_doc/musicgen#transformers.MusicgenProcessor) to pre-process
the inputs:

```python
>>> from transformers import AutoProcessor, MusicgenForConditionalGeneration

>>> processor = AutoProcessor.from_pretrained("facebook/musicgen-small")
>>> model = MusicgenForConditionalGeneration.from_pretrained("facebook/musicgen-small")

>>> inputs = processor(
...     text=["80s pop track with bassy drums and synth", "90s rock song with loud guitars and heavy drums"],
...     padding=True,
...     return_tensors="pt",
... )
>>> audio_values = model.generate(**inputs, do_sample=True, guidance_scale=3, max_new_tokens=256)
```

The `guidance_scale` is used in classifier free guidance (CFG), setting the weighting between the conditional logits
(which are predicted from the text prompts) and the unconditional logits (which are predicted from an unconditional or
'null' prompt). Higher guidance scale encourages the model to generate samples that are more closely linked to the input
prompt, usually at the expense of poorer audio quality. CFG is enabled by setting `guidance_scale > 1`. For best results,
use `guidance_scale=3` (default).

### Audio-Prompted Generation

The same [MusicgenProcessor](/docs/transformers/main/en/model_doc/musicgen#transformers.MusicgenProcessor) can be used to pre-process an audio prompt that is used for audio continuation. In the
following example, we load an audio file using the 🤗 Datasets library, which can be pip installed through the command
below:

```bash
pip install --upgrade pip
pip install datasets[audio]
```

```python
>>> from transformers import AutoProcessor, MusicgenForConditionalGeneration
>>> from datasets import load_dataset

>>> processor = AutoProcessor.from_pretrained("facebook/musicgen-small")
>>> model = MusicgenForConditionalGeneration.from_pretrained("facebook/musicgen-small")

>>> dataset = load_dataset("sanchit-gandhi/gtzan", split="train", streaming=True)
>>> sample = next(iter(dataset))["audio"]

>>> # take the first half of the audio sample
>>> sample["array"] = sample["array"][: len(sample["array"]) // 2]

>>> inputs = processor(
...     audio=sample["array"],
...     sampling_rate=sample["sampling_rate"],
...     text=["80s blues track with groovy saxophone"],
...     padding=True,
...     return_tensors="pt",
... )
>>> audio_values = model.generate(**inputs, do_sample=True, guidance_scale=3, max_new_tokens=256)
```

For batched audio-prompted generation, the generated `audio_values` can be post-processed to remove padding by using the
[MusicgenProcessor](/docs/transformers/main/en/model_doc/musicgen#transformers.MusicgenProcessor) class:

```python
>>> from transformers import AutoProcessor, MusicgenForConditionalGeneration
>>> from datasets import load_dataset

>>> processor = AutoProcessor.from_pretrained("facebook/musicgen-small")
>>> model = MusicgenForConditionalGeneration.from_pretrained("facebook/musicgen-small")

>>> dataset = load_dataset("sanchit-gandhi/gtzan", split="train", streaming=True)
>>> sample = next(iter(dataset))["audio"]

>>> # take the first quarter of the audio sample
>>> sample_1 = sample["array"][: len(sample["array"]) // 4]

>>> # take the first half of the audio sample
>>> sample_2 = sample["array"][: len(sample["array"]) // 2]

>>> inputs = processor(
...     audio=[sample_1, sample_2],
...     sampling_rate=sample["sampling_rate"],
...     text=["80s blues track with groovy saxophone", "90s rock song with loud guitars and heavy drums"],
...     padding=True,
...     return_tensors="pt",
... )
>>> audio_values = model.generate(**inputs, do_sample=True, guidance_scale=3, max_new_tokens=256)

>>> # post-process to remove padding from the batched audio
>>> audio_values = processor.batch_decode(audio_values, padding_mask=inputs.padding_mask)
```

### Generation Configuration

The default parameters that control the generation process, such as sampling, guidance scale and number of generated
tokens, can be found in the model's generation config, and updated as desired:

```python
>>> from transformers import MusicgenForConditionalGeneration

>>> model = MusicgenForConditionalGeneration.from_pretrained("facebook/musicgen-small")

>>> # inspect the default generation config
>>> model.generation_config

>>> # increase the guidance scale to 4.0
>>> model.generation_config.guidance_scale = 4.0

>>> # decrease the max length to 256 tokens
>>> model.generation_config.max_length = 256
```

Note that any arguments passed to the generate method will **supersede** those in the generation config, so setting
`do_sample=False` in the call to generate will supersede the setting of `model.generation_config.do_sample` in the
generation config.

## Model Structure

The MusicGen model can be de-composed into three distinct stages:

1. Text encoder: maps the text inputs to a sequence of hidden-state representations. The pre-trained MusicGen models use a frozen text encoder from either T5 or Flan-T5
2. MusicGen decoder: a language model (LM) that auto-regressively generates audio tokens (or codes) conditional on the encoder hidden-state representations
3. Audio encoder/decoder: used to encode an audio prompt to use as prompt tokens, and recover the audio waveform from the audio tokens predicted by the decoder

Thus, the MusicGen model can either be used as a standalone decoder model, corresponding to the class [MusicgenForCausalLM](/docs/transformers/main/en/model_doc/musicgen#transformers.MusicgenForCausalLM),
or as a composite model that includes the text encoder and audio encoder/decoder, corresponding to the class
[MusicgenForConditionalGeneration](/docs/transformers/main/en/model_doc/musicgen#transformers.MusicgenForConditionalGeneration). If only the decoder needs to be loaded from the pre-trained checkpoint, it can be loaded by first
specifying the correct config, or be accessed through the `.decoder` attribute of the composite model:

```python
>>> from transformers import AutoConfig, MusicgenForCausalLM, MusicgenForConditionalGeneration

>>> # Option 1: get decoder config and pass to `.from_pretrained`
>>> decoder_config = AutoConfig.from_pretrained("facebook/musicgen-small").decoder
>>> decoder = MusicgenForCausalLM.from_pretrained("facebook/musicgen-small", **decoder_config)

>>> # Option 2: load the entire composite model, but only return the decoder
>>> decoder = MusicgenForConditionalGeneration.from_pretrained("facebook/musicgen-small").decoder
```

Since the text encoder and audio encoder/decoder models are frozen during training, the MusicGen decoder [MusicgenForCausalLM](/docs/transformers/main/en/model_doc/musicgen#transformers.MusicgenForCausalLM)
can be trained standalone on a dataset of encoder hidden-states and audio codes. For inference, the trained decoder can
be combined with the frozen text encoder and audio encoder/decoders to recover the composite [MusicgenForConditionalGeneration](/docs/transformers/main/en/model_doc/musicgen#transformers.MusicgenForConditionalGeneration)
model.

Tips:

* MusicGen is trained on the 32kHz checkpoint of Encodec. You should ensure you use a compatible version of the Encodec model.
* Sampling mode tends to deliver better results than greedy - you can toggle sampling with the variable `do_sample` in the call to `MusicgenForConditionalGeneration.generate()`

  Indices of input sequence tokens in the vocabulary, corresponding to the sequence of audio codes.

  Indices can be obtained by encoding an audio prompt with an audio encoder model to predict audio codes,
  such as with the [EncodecModel](/docs/transformers/main/en/model_doc/encodec#transformers.EncodecModel). See [EncodecModel.encode()](/docs/transformers/main/en/model_doc/encodec#transformers.EncodecModel.encode) for details.

  [What are input IDs?](../glossary#input-ids)

  

  The `input_ids` will automatically be converted from shape `(batch_size * num_codebooks,
  target_sequence_length)` to `(batch_size, num_codebooks, target_sequence_length)` in the forward pass. If
  you obtain audio codes from an audio encoding model, such as [EncodecModel](/docs/transformers/main/en/model_doc/encodec#transformers.EncodecModel), ensure that the number of
  frames is equal to 1, and that you reshape the audio codes from `(frames, batch_size, num_codebooks,
  target_sequence_length)` to `(batch_size * num_codebooks, target_sequence_length)` prior to passing them as
  `input_ids`.

  
- **attention_mask** (`torch.Tensor` of shape `(batch_size, sequence_length)`, *optional*) --
  Mask to avoid performing attention on padding token indices. Mask values selected in `[0, 1]`:

  - 1 for tokens that are **not masked**,
  - 0 for tokens that are **masked**.

  [What are attention masks?](../glossary#attention-mask)
- **encoder_hidden_states** (`torch.FloatTensor` of shape `(batch_size, encoder_sequence_length, hidden_size)`, *optional*) --
  Sequence of hidden-states at the output of the last layer of the encoder. Used in the cross-attention of
  the decoder.
- **encoder_attention_mask** (`torch.LongTensor` of shape `(batch_size, encoder_sequence_length)`, *optional*) --
  Mask to avoid performing cross-attention on padding tokens indices of encoder input_ids. Mask values
  selected in `[0, 1]`:

  - 1 for tokens that are **not masked**,
  - 0 for tokens that are **masked**.

  [What are attention masks?](../glossary#attention-mask)
- **past_key_values** (`~cache_utils.Cache`, *optional*) --
  Pre-computed hidden-states (key and values in the self-attention blocks and in the cross-attention
  blocks) that can be used to speed up sequential decoding. This typically consists in the `past_key_values`
  returned by the model at a previous stage of decoding, when `use_cache=True` or `config.use_cache=True`.

  Only [Cache](/docs/transformers/main/en/internal/generation_utils#transformers.Cache) instance is allowed as input, see our [kv cache guide](https://huggingface.co/docs/transformers/en/kv_cache).
  If no `past_key_values` are passed, [DynamicCache](/docs/transformers/main/en/internal/generation_utils#transformers.DynamicCache) will be initialized by default.

  The model will output the same cache format that is fed as input.

  If `past_key_values` are used, the user is expected to input only unprocessed `input_ids` (those that don't
  have their past key value states given to this model) of shape `(batch_size, unprocessed_length)` instead of all `input_ids`
  of shape `(batch_size, sequence_length)`.
- **inputs_embeds** (`torch.FloatTensor` of shape `(batch_size, sequence_length, hidden_size)`, *optional*) --
  Optionally, instead of passing `input_ids` you can choose to directly pass an embedded representation. This
  is useful if you want more control over how to convert `input_ids` indices into associated vectors than the
  model's internal embedding lookup matrix.
- **use_cache** (`bool`, *optional*) --
  If set to `True`, `past_key_values` key value states are returned and can be used to speed up decoding (see
  `past_key_values`).
- **output_attentions** (`bool`, *optional*) --
  Whether or not to return the attentions tensors of all attention layers. See `attentions` under returned
  tensors for more detail.
- **output_hidden_states** (`bool`, *optional*) --
  Whether or not to return the hidden states of all layers. See `hidden_states` under returned tensors for
  more detail.
- **return_dict** (`bool`, *optional*) --
  Whether or not to return a [ModelOutput](/docs/transformers/main/en/main_classes/output#transformers.utils.ModelOutput) instead of a plain tuple.
- **cache_position** (`torch.Tensor` of shape `(sequence_length)`, *optional*) --
  Indices depicting the position of the input sequence tokens in the sequence. Contrarily to `position_ids`,
  this tensor is not affected by padding. It is used to update the cache in the correct position and to infer
  the complete sequence length.0[transformers.modeling_outputs.BaseModelOutputWithPastAndCrossAttentions](/docs/transformers/main/en/main_classes/output#transformers.modeling_outputs.BaseModelOutputWithPastAndCrossAttentions) or `tuple(torch.FloatTensor)`A [transformers.modeling_outputs.BaseModelOutputWithPastAndCrossAttentions](/docs/transformers/main/en/main_classes/output#transformers.modeling_outputs.BaseModelOutputWithPastAndCrossAttentions) or a tuple of
`torch.FloatTensor` (if `return_dict=False` is passed or when `config.return_dict=False`) comprising various
elements depending on the configuration ([MusicgenConfig](/docs/transformers/main/en/model_doc/musicgen#transformers.MusicgenConfig)) and inputs.

- **last_hidden_state** (`torch.FloatTensor` of shape `(batch_size, sequence_length, hidden_size)`) -- Sequence of hidden-states at the output of the last layer of the model.

  If `past_key_values` is used only the last hidden-state of the sequences of shape `(batch_size, 1,
  hidden_size)` is output.
- **past_key_values** (`Cache`, *optional*, returned when `use_cache=True` is passed or when `config.use_cache=True`) -- It is a [Cache](/docs/transformers/main/en/internal/generation_utils#transformers.Cache) instance. For more details, see our [kv cache guide](https://huggingface.co/docs/transformers/en/kv_cache).

  Contains pre-computed hidden-states (key and values in the self-attention blocks and optionally if
  `config.is_encoder_decoder=True` in the cross-attention blocks) that can be used (see `past_key_values`
  input) to speed up sequential decoding.
- **hidden_states** (`tuple(torch.FloatTensor)`, *optional*, returned when `output_hidden_states=True` is passed or when `config.output_hidden_states=True`) -- Tuple of `torch.FloatTensor` (one for the output of the embeddings, if the model has an embedding layer, +
  one for the output of each layer) of shape `(batch_size, sequence_length, hidden_size)`.

  Hidden-states of the model at the output of each layer plus the optional initial embedding outputs.
- **attentions** (`tuple(torch.FloatTensor)`, *optional*, returned when `output_attentions=True` is passed or when `config.output_attentions=True`) -- Tuple of `torch.FloatTensor` (one for each layer) of shape `(batch_size, num_heads, sequence_length,
  sequence_length)`.

  Attentions weights after the attention softmax, used to compute the weighted average in the self-attention
  heads.
- **cross_attentions** (`tuple(torch.FloatTensor)`, *optional*, returned when `output_attentions=True` and `config.add_cross_attention=True` is passed or when `config.output_attentions=True`) -- Tuple of `torch.FloatTensor` (one for each layer) of shape `(batch_size, num_heads, sequence_length,
  sequence_length)`.

  Attentions weights of the decoder's cross-attention layer, after the attention softmax, used to compute the
  weighted average in the cross-attention heads.
The [MusicgenModel](/docs/transformers/main/en/model_doc/musicgen#transformers.MusicgenModel) forward method, overrides the `__call__` special method.

Although the recipe for forward pass needs to be defined within this function, one should call the `Module`
instance afterwards instead of this since the former takes care of running the pre and post processing steps while
the latter silently ignores them.

The MusicGen decoder model with a language modelling head on top.

This model inherits from [PreTrainedModel](/docs/transformers/main/en/main_classes/model#transformers.PreTrainedModel). Check the superclass documentation for the generic methods the
library implements for all its model (such as downloading or saving, resizing the input embeddings, pruning heads
etc.)

This model is also a PyTorch [torch.nn.Module](https://pytorch.org/docs/stable/nn.html#torch.nn.Module) subclass.
Use it as a regular PyTorch Module and refer to the PyTorch documentation for all matter related to general usage
and behavior.

  Indices can be obtained by encoding an audio prompt with an audio encoder model to predict audio codes,
  such as with the [EncodecModel](/docs/transformers/main/en/model_doc/encodec#transformers.EncodecModel). See [EncodecModel.encode()](/docs/transformers/main/en/model_doc/encodec#transformers.EncodecModel.encode) for details.

  The `input_ids` will automatically be converted from shape `(batch_size * num_codebooks,
  target_sequence_length)` to `(batch_size, num_codebooks, target_sequence_length)` in the forward pass. If
  you obtain audio codes from an audio encoding model, such as [EncodecModel](/docs/transformers/main/en/model_doc/encodec#transformers.EncodecModel), ensure that the number of
  frames is equal to 1, and that you reshape the audio codes from `(frames, batch_size, num_codebooks,
  target_sequence_length)` to `(batch_size * num_codebooks, target_sequence_length)` prior to passing them as
  `input_ids`.

  `labels = input_ids` Indices are selected in `[-100, 0, ..., config.vocab_size]` All labels set to `-100`
  are ignored (masked), the loss is only computed for labels in `[0, ..., config.vocab_size]`

The [MusicgenForCausalLM](/docs/transformers/main/en/model_doc/musicgen#transformers.MusicgenForCausalLM) forward method, overrides the `__call__` special method.

Although the recipe for forward pass needs to be defined within this function, one should call the `Module`
instance afterwards instead of this since the former takes care of running the pre and post processing steps while
the latter silently ignores them.

The [MusicgenForConditionalGeneration](/docs/transformers/main/en/model_doc/musicgen#transformers.MusicgenForConditionalGeneration) forward method, overrides the `__call__` special method.

Although the recipe for forward pass needs to be defined within this function, one should call the `Module`
instance afterwards instead of this since the former takes care of running the pre and post processing steps while
the latter silently ignores them.

Examples:
```python
>>> from transformers import AutoProcessor, MusicgenForConditionalGeneration
>>> import torch

>>> processor = AutoProcessor.from_pretrained("facebook/musicgen-small")
>>> model = MusicgenForConditionalGeneration.from_pretrained("facebook/musicgen-small")

>>> inputs = processor(
...     text=["80s pop track with bassy drums and synth", "90s rock song with loud guitars and heavy drums"],
...     padding=True,
...     return_tensors="pt",
... )

>>> pad_token_id = model.generation_config.pad_token_id
>>> decoder_input_ids = (
...     torch.ones((inputs.input_ids.shape[0] * model.decoder.num_codebooks, 1), dtype=torch.long)
...     * pad_token_id
... )

>>> logits = model(**inputs, decoder_input_ids=decoder_input_ids).logits
>>> logits.shape  # (bsz * num_codebooks, tgt_len, vocab_size)
torch.Size([8, 1, 2048])
```

**Parameters:**

config ([MusicgenConfig](/docs/transformers/main/en/model_doc/musicgen#transformers.MusicgenConfig), *optional*) : Model configuration class with all the parameters of the model. Initializing with a config file does not load the weights associated with the model, only the configuration. Check out the [from_pretrained()](/docs/transformers/main/en/main_classes/model#transformers.PreTrainedModel.from_pretrained) method to load the model weights.

text_encoder (`PreTrainedModel`, *optional*) : The text encoder model that encodes text into hidden states for conditioning.

audio_encoder (`PreTrainedModel`, *optional*) : The audio encoder model that encodes audio into hidden states for conditioning.

decoder (`MusicgenForCausalLM`, *optional*) : The decoder model that generates audio tokens based on conditioning signals.

**Returns:**
