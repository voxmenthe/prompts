# MPNet

## Overview

The MPNet model was proposed in [MPNet: Masked and Permuted Pre-training for Language Understanding](https://huggingface.co/papers/2004.09297) by Kaitao Song, Xu Tan, Tao Qin, Jianfeng Lu, Tie-Yan Liu.

MPNet adopts a novel pre-training method, named masked and permuted language modeling, to inherit the advantages of
masked language modeling and permuted language modeling for natural language understanding.

The abstract from the paper is the following:

*BERT adopts masked language modeling (MLM) for pre-training and is one of the most successful pre-training models.
Since BERT neglects dependency among predicted tokens, XLNet introduces permuted language modeling (PLM) for
pre-training to address this problem. However, XLNet does not leverage the full position information of a sentence and
thus suffers from position discrepancy between pre-training and fine-tuning. In this paper, we propose MPNet, a novel
pre-training method that inherits the advantages of BERT and XLNet and avoids their limitations. MPNet leverages the
dependency among predicted tokens through permuted language modeling (vs. MLM in BERT), and takes auxiliary position
information as input to make the model see a full sentence and thus reducing the position discrepancy (vs. PLM in
XLNet). We pre-train MPNet on a large-scale dataset (over 160GB text corpora) and fine-tune on a variety of
down-streaming tasks (GLUE, SQuAD, etc). Experimental results show that MPNet outperforms MLM and PLM by a large
margin, and achieves better results on these tasks compared with previous state-of-the-art pre-trained methods (e.g.,
BERT, XLNet, RoBERTa) under the same model setting.*

The original code can be found [here](https://github.com/microsoft/MPNet).

## Usage tips

MPNet doesn't have `token_type_ids`, you don't need to indicate which token belongs to which segment. Just
separate your segments with the separation token `tokenizer.sep_token` (or `[sep]`).

## MPNetConfig[[transformers.MPNetConfig]]

#### transformers.MPNetConfig[[transformers.MPNetConfig]]

[Source](https://github.com/huggingface/transformers/blob/main/src/transformers/models/mpnet/configuration_mpnet.py#L25)

This is the configuration class to store the configuration of a [MPNetModel](/docs/transformers/main/en/model_doc/mpnet#transformers.MPNetModel). It is used to
instantiate a MPNet model according to the specified arguments, defining the model architecture. Instantiating a
configuration with the defaults will yield a similar configuration to that of the MPNet
[microsoft/mpnet-base](https://huggingface.co/microsoft/mpnet-base) architecture.

Configuration objects inherit from [PreTrainedConfig](/docs/transformers/main/en/main_classes/configuration#transformers.PreTrainedConfig) and can be used to control the model outputs. Read the
documentation from [PreTrainedConfig](/docs/transformers/main/en/main_classes/configuration#transformers.PreTrainedConfig) for more information.

Examples:

```python
>>> from transformers import MPNetModel, MPNetConfig

>>> # Initializing a MPNet mpnet-base style configuration
>>> configuration = MPNetConfig()

>>> # Initializing a model from the mpnet-base style configuration
>>> model = MPNetModel(configuration)

>>> # Accessing the model configuration
>>> configuration = model.config
```

**Parameters:**

vocab_size (`int`, *optional*, defaults to 30527) : Vocabulary size of the MPNet model. Defines the number of different tokens that can be represented by the `inputs_ids` passed when calling [MPNetModel](/docs/transformers/main/en/model_doc/mpnet#transformers.MPNetModel).

Construct a MPNet tokenizer (backed by HuggingFace's *tokenizers* library). Based on WordPiece.

This tokenizer inherits from [TokenizersBackend](/docs/transformers/main/en/main_classes/tokenizer#transformers.TokenizersBackend) which contains most of the main methods. Users should
refer to this superclass for more information regarding those methods.

- **token_ids_1** -- Unused when `already_has_special_tokens=True`. Must be None in that case.
- **already_has_special_tokens** -- Whether the sequence is already formatted with special tokens.0A list of integers in the range [0, 1]1 for a special token, 0 for a sequence token.

Retrieve sequence ids from a token list that has no special tokens added.

For fast tokenizers, data collators call this with `already_has_special_tokens=True` to build a mask over an
already-formatted sequence. In that case, we compute the mask by checking membership in `all_special_ids`.

do_lower_case (`bool`, *optional*, defaults to `True`) : Whether or not to lowercase the input when tokenizing.

bos_token (`str`, *optional*, defaults to `""`) : The beginning of sequence token that was used during pretraining. Can be used a sequence classifier token.    When building a sequence using special tokens, this is not the token that is used for the beginning of sequence. The token used is the `cls_token`.   

eos_token (`str`, *optional*, defaults to `""`) : The end of sequence token.    When building a sequence using special tokens, this is not the token that is used for the end of sequence. The token used is the `sep_token`.   

sep_token (`str`, *optional*, defaults to `""`) : The separator token, which is used when building a sequence from multiple sequences, e.g. two sequences for sequence classification or for a text and a question for question answering. It is also used as the last token of a sequence built with special tokens.

cls_token (`str`, *optional*, defaults to `""`) : The classifier token which is used when doing sequence classification (classification of the whole sequence instead of per-token classification). It is the first token of the sequence when built with special tokens.

unk_token (`str`, *optional*, defaults to `"[UNK]"`) : The unknown token. A token that is not in the vocabulary cannot be converted to an ID and is set to be this token instead.

pad_token (`str`, *optional*, defaults to `""`) : The token used for padding, for example when batching sequences of different lengths.

mask_token (`str`, *optional*, defaults to `""`) : The token used for masking values. This is the token used when training this model with masked language modeling. This is the token which the model will try to predict.

tokenize_chinese_chars (`bool`, *optional*, defaults to `True`) : Whether or not to tokenize Chinese characters. This should likely be deactivated for Japanese (see [this issue](https://github.com/huggingface/transformers/issues/328)).

**Returns:**

`A list of integers in the range [0, 1]`

instance afterwards instead of this since the former takes care of running the pre and post processing steps while
the latter silently ignores them.

>>> predicted_class_id = logits.argmax().item()

**Parameters:**

config ([MPNetForTokenClassification](/docs/transformers/main/en/model_doc/mpnet#transformers.MPNetForTokenClassification)) : Model configuration class with all the parameters of the model. Initializing with a config file does not load the weights associated with the model, only the configuration. Check out the [from_pretrained()](/docs/transformers/main/en/main_classes/model#transformers.PreTrainedModel.from_pretrained) method to load the model weights.

[Source](https://github.com/huggingface/transformers/blob/main/src/transformers/models/mpnet/modeling_mpnet.py#L815)

The Mpnet transformer with a span classification head on top for extractive question-answering tasks like
SQuAD (a linear layer on top of the hidden-states output to compute `span start logits` and `span end logits`).

This model inherits from [PreTrainedModel](/docs/transformers/main/en/main_classes/model#transformers.PreTrainedModel). Check the superclass documentation for the generic methods the
library implements for all its model (such as downloading or saving, resizing the input embeddings, pruning heads
etc.)

This model is also a PyTorch [torch.nn.Module](https://pytorch.org/docs/stable/nn.html#torch.nn.Module) subclass.
Use it as a regular PyTorch Module and refer to the PyTorch documentation for all matter related to general usage
and behavior.

  Indices of input sequence tokens in the vocabulary. Padding will be ignored by default.

  Indices can be obtained using [AutoTokenizer](/docs/transformers/main/en/model_doc/auto#transformers.AutoTokenizer). See [PreTrainedTokenizer.encode()](/docs/transformers/main/en/internal/tokenization_utils#transformers.PreTrainedTokenizerBase.encode) and
  [PreTrainedTokenizer.__call__()](/docs/transformers/main/en/internal/tokenization_utils#transformers.PreTrainedTokenizerBase.__call__) for details.

  [What are input IDs?](../glossary#input-ids)
- **attention_mask** (`torch.FloatTensor` of shape `(batch_size, sequence_length)`, *optional*) --
  Mask to avoid performing attention on padding token indices. Mask values selected in `[0, 1]`:

  - 1 for tokens that are **not masked**,
  - 0 for tokens that are **masked**.

  [What are attention masks?](../glossary#attention-mask)
- **position_ids** (`torch.LongTensor` of shape `(batch_size, sequence_length)`, *optional*) --
  Indices of positions of each input sequence tokens in the position embeddings. Selected in the range `[0, config.n_positions - 1]`.

  [What are position IDs?](../glossary#position-ids)
- **inputs_embeds** (`torch.FloatTensor` of shape `(batch_size, sequence_length, hidden_size)`, *optional*) --
  Optionally, instead of passing `input_ids` you can choose to directly pass an embedded representation. This
  is useful if you want more control over how to convert `input_ids` indices into associated vectors than the
  model's internal embedding lookup matrix.
- **start_positions** (`torch.LongTensor` of shape `(batch_size,)`, *optional*) --
  Labels for position (index) of the start of the labelled span for computing the token classification loss.
  Positions are clamped to the length of the sequence (`sequence_length`). Position outside of the sequence
  are not taken into account for computing the loss.
- **end_positions** (`torch.LongTensor` of shape `(batch_size,)`, *optional*) --
  Labels for position (index) of the end of the labelled span for computing the token classification loss.
  Positions are clamped to the length of the sequence (`sequence_length`). Position outside of the sequence
  are not taken into account for computing the loss.
- **output_attentions** (`bool`, *optional*) --
  Whether or not to return the attentions tensors of all attention layers. See `attentions` under returned
  tensors for more detail.
- **output_hidden_states** (`bool`, *optional*) --
  Whether or not to return the hidden states of all layers. See `hidden_states` under returned tensors for
  more detail.
- **return_dict** (`bool`, *optional*) --
  Whether or not to return a [ModelOutput](/docs/transformers/main/en/main_classes/output#transformers.utils.ModelOutput) instead of a plain tuple.0[transformers.modeling_outputs.QuestionAnsweringModelOutput](/docs/transformers/main/en/main_classes/output#transformers.modeling_outputs.QuestionAnsweringModelOutput) or `tuple(torch.FloatTensor)`A [transformers.modeling_outputs.QuestionAnsweringModelOutput](/docs/transformers/main/en/main_classes/output#transformers.modeling_outputs.QuestionAnsweringModelOutput) or a tuple of
`torch.FloatTensor` (if `return_dict=False` is passed or when `config.return_dict=False`) comprising various
elements depending on the configuration ([MPNetConfig](/docs/transformers/main/en/model_doc/mpnet#transformers.MPNetConfig)) and inputs.

- **loss** (`torch.FloatTensor` of shape `(1,)`, *optional*, returned when `labels` is provided) -- Total span extraction loss is the sum of a Cross-Entropy for the start and end positions.
- **start_logits** (`torch.FloatTensor` of shape `(batch_size, sequence_length)`) -- Span-start scores (before SoftMax).
- **end_logits** (`torch.FloatTensor` of shape `(batch_size, sequence_length)`) -- Span-end scores (before SoftMax).
- **hidden_states** (`tuple(torch.FloatTensor)`, *optional*, returned when `output_hidden_states=True` is passed or when `config.output_hidden_states=True`) -- Tuple of `torch.FloatTensor` (one for the output of the embeddings, if the model has an embedding layer, +
  one for the output of each layer) of shape `(batch_size, sequence_length, hidden_size)`.

  Hidden-states of the model at the output of each layer plus the optional initial embedding outputs.
- **attentions** (`tuple(torch.FloatTensor)`, *optional*, returned when `output_attentions=True` is passed or when `config.output_attentions=True`) -- Tuple of `torch.FloatTensor` (one for each layer) of shape `(batch_size, num_heads, sequence_length,
  sequence_length)`.

  Attentions weights after the attention softmax, used to compute the weighted average in the self-attention
  heads.
The [MPNetForQuestionAnswering](/docs/transformers/main/en/model_doc/mpnet#transformers.MPNetForQuestionAnswering) forward method, overrides the `__call__` special method.

Although the recipe for forward pass needs to be defined within this function, one should call the `Module`
instance afterwards instead of this since the former takes care of running the pre and post processing steps while
the latter silently ignores them.

Example:

```python
>>> from transformers import AutoTokenizer, MPNetForQuestionAnswering
>>> import torch

>>> tokenizer = AutoTokenizer.from_pretrained("microsoft/mpnet-base")
>>> model = MPNetForQuestionAnswering.from_pretrained("microsoft/mpnet-base")

>>> question, text = "Who was Jim Henson?", "Jim Henson was a nice puppet"

>>> inputs = tokenizer(question, text, return_tensors="pt")
>>> with torch.no_grad():
...     outputs = model(**inputs)

>>> answer_start_index = outputs.start_logits.argmax()
>>> answer_end_index = outputs.end_logits.argmax()

>>> predict_answer_tokens = inputs.input_ids[0, answer_start_index : answer_end_index + 1]
>>> tokenizer.decode(predict_answer_tokens, skip_special_tokens=True)
...

>>> # target is "nice puppet"
>>> target_start_index = torch.tensor([14])
>>> target_end_index = torch.tensor([15])

>>> outputs = model(**inputs, start_positions=target_start_index, end_positions=target_end_index)
>>> loss = outputs.loss
>>> round(loss.item(), 2)
...
