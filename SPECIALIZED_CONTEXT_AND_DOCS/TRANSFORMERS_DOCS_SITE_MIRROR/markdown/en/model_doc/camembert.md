# CamemBERT

[CamemBERT](https://huggingface.co/papers/1911.03894) is a language model based on [RoBERTa](./roberta), but trained specifically on French text from the OSCAR dataset, making it more effective for French language tasks.

What sets CamemBERT apart is that it learned from a huge, high quality collection of French data, as opposed to mixing lots of languages. This helps it really understand French better than many multilingual models.

Common applications of CamemBERT include masked language modeling (Fill-mask prediction), text classification (sentiment analysis), token classification (entity recognition) and sentence pair classification (entailment tasks).

You can find all the original CamemBERT checkpoints under the [ALMAnaCH](https://huggingface.co/almanach/models?search=camembert) organization.

The examples below demonstrate how to predict the `` token with [Pipeline](/docs/transformers/main/en/main_classes/pipelines#transformers.Pipeline), [AutoModel](/docs/transformers/main/en/model_doc/auto#transformers.AutoModel), and from the command line.

```python
import torch
from transformers import pipeline

pipeline = pipeline("fill-mask", model="camembert-base", dtype=torch.float16, device=0)
pipeline("Le camembert est un délicieux fromage .")
```

```python
import torch
from transformers import AutoTokenizer, AutoModelForMaskedLM

tokenizer = AutoTokenizer.from_pretrained("camembert-base")
model = AutoModelForMaskedLM.from_pretrained("camembert-base", dtype="auto", device_map="auto", attn_implementation="sdpa")
inputs = tokenizer("Le camembert est un délicieux fromage .", return_tensors="pt").to(model.device)

with torch.no_grad():
    outputs = model(**inputs)
    predictions = outputs.logits

masked_index = torch.where(inputs['input_ids'] == tokenizer.mask_token_id)[1]
predicted_token_id = predictions[0, masked_index].argmax(dim=-1)
predicted_token = tokenizer.decode(predicted_token_id)

print(f"The predicted token is: {predicted_token}")
```

```bash
echo -e "Le camembert est un délicieux fromage ." | transformers run --task fill-mask --model camembert-base --device 0
```

Quantization reduces the memory burden of large models by representing weights in lower precision. Refer to the [Quantization](../quantization/overview) overview for available options.

The example below uses [bitsandbytes](../quantization/bitsandbytes) quantization to quantize the weights to 8-bits.

```python
from transformers import AutoTokenizer, AutoModelForMaskedLM, BitsAndBytesConfig
import torch

quant_config = BitsAndBytesConfig(load_in_8bit=True)
model = AutoModelForMaskedLM.from_pretrained(
    "almanach/camembert-large",
    quantization_config=quant_config,
    device_map="auto"
)
tokenizer = AutoTokenizer.from_pretrained("almanach/camembert-large")

inputs = tokenizer("Le camembert est un délicieux fromage .", return_tensors="pt").to(model.device)

with torch.no_grad():
    outputs = model(**inputs)
    predictions = outputs.logits

masked_index = torch.where(inputs["input_ids"] == tokenizer.mask_token_id)[1]
predicted_token_id = predictions[0, masked_index].argmax(dim=-1)
predicted_token = tokenizer.decode(predicted_token_id)

print(f"The predicted token is: {predicted_token}")
```

#### transformers.CamembertConfig[[transformers.CamembertConfig]]

[Source](https://github.com/huggingface/transformers/blob/main/src/transformers/models/camembert/configuration_camembert.py#L25)

This is the configuration class to store the configuration of a [CamembertModel](/docs/transformers/main/en/model_doc/camembert#transformers.CamembertModel). It is
used to instantiate a Camembert model according to the specified arguments, defining the model architecture.
Instantiating a configuration with the defaults will yield a similar configuration to that of the Camembert
[almanach/camembert-base](https://huggingface.co/almanach/camembert-base) architecture.

Configuration objects inherit from [PreTrainedConfig](/docs/transformers/main/en/main_classes/configuration#transformers.PreTrainedConfig) and can be used to control the model outputs. Read the
documentation from [PreTrainedConfig](/docs/transformers/main/en/main_classes/configuration#transformers.PreTrainedConfig) for more information.

Example:

```python
>>> from transformers import CamembertConfig, CamembertModel

>>> # Initializing a Camembert almanach/camembert-base style configuration
>>> configuration = CamembertConfig()

>>> # Initializing a model (with random weights) from the almanach/camembert-base style configuration
>>> model = CamembertModel(configuration)

>>> # Accessing the model configuration
>>> configuration = model.config
```

- **token_ids_1** -- Unused when `already_has_special_tokens=True`. Must be None in that case.
- **already_has_special_tokens** -- Whether the sequence is already formatted with special tokens.0A list of integers in the range [0, 1]1 for a special token, 0 for a sequence token.

Retrieve sequence ids from a token list that has no special tokens added.

For fast tokenizers, data collators call this with `already_has_special_tokens=True` to build a mask over an
already-formatted sequence. In that case, we compute the mask by checking membership in `all_special_ids`.

**Parameters:**

## CamembertModel[[transformers.CamembertModel]]

#### transformers.CamembertModel[[transformers.CamembertModel]]

[Source](https://github.com/huggingface/transformers/blob/main/src/transformers/models/camembert/modeling_camembert.py#L589)

The model can behave as an encoder (with only self-attention) as well as a decoder, in which case a layer of
cross-attention is added between the self-attention layers, following the architecture described in [Attention is
all you need](https://huggingface.co/papers/1706.03762) by Ashish Vaswani, Noam Shazeer, Niki Parmar, Jakob Uszkoreit,
Llion Jones, Aidan N. Gomez, Lukasz Kaiser and Illia Polosukhin.

To behave as an decoder the model needs to be initialized with the `is_decoder` argument of the configuration set
to `True`. To be used in a Seq2Seq model, the model needs to initialized with both `is_decoder` argument and
`add_cross_attention` set to `True`; an `encoder_hidden_states` is then expected as an input to the forward pass.

This model inherits from [PreTrainedModel](/docs/transformers/main/en/main_classes/model#transformers.PreTrainedModel). Check the superclass documentation for the generic methods the
library implements for all its model (such as downloading or saving, resizing the input embeddings, pruning heads
etc.)

This model is also a PyTorch [torch.nn.Module](https://pytorch.org/docs/stable/nn.html#torch.nn.Module) subclass.
Use it as a regular PyTorch Module and refer to the PyTorch documentation for all matter related to general usage
and behavior.

  Indices of input sequence tokens in the vocabulary. Padding will be ignored by default.

  Indices can be obtained using [AutoTokenizer](/docs/transformers/main/en/model_doc/auto#transformers.AutoTokenizer). See [PreTrainedTokenizer.encode()](/docs/transformers/main/en/internal/tokenization_utils#transformers.PreTrainedTokenizerBase.encode) and

  [What are input IDs?](../glossary#input-ids)
- **attention_mask** (`torch.Tensor` of shape `(batch_size, sequence_length)`, *optional*) --
  Mask to avoid performing attention on padding token indices. Mask values selected in `[0, 1]`:

  - 1 for tokens that are **not masked**,
  - 0 for tokens that are **masked**.

  [What are attention masks?](../glossary#attention-mask)
- **token_type_ids** (`torch.Tensor` of shape `(batch_size, sequence_length)`, *optional*) --
  Segment token indices to indicate first and second portions of the inputs. Indices are selected in `[0, 1]`:

  - 0 corresponds to a *sentence A* token,
  - 1 corresponds to a *sentence B* token.

  [What are token type IDs?](../glossary#token-type-ids)
- **position_ids** (`torch.Tensor` of shape `(batch_size, sequence_length)`, *optional*) --
  Indices of positions of each input sequence tokens in the position embeddings. Selected in the range `[0, config.n_positions - 1]`.

  [What are position IDs?](../glossary#position-ids)
- **inputs_embeds** (`torch.Tensor` of shape `(batch_size, sequence_length, hidden_size)`, *optional*) --
  Optionally, instead of passing `input_ids` you can choose to directly pass an embedded representation. This
  is useful if you want more control over how to convert `input_ids` indices into associated vectors than the
  model's internal embedding lookup matrix.
- **encoder_hidden_states** (`torch.Tensor` of shape `(batch_size, sequence_length, hidden_size)`, *optional*) --
  Sequence of hidden-states at the output of the last layer of the encoder. Used in the cross-attention
  if the model is configured as a decoder.
- **encoder_attention_mask** (`torch.Tensor` of shape `(batch_size, sequence_length)`, *optional*) --
  Mask to avoid performing attention on the padding token indices of the encoder input. This mask is used in
  the cross-attention if the model is configured as a decoder. Mask values selected in `[0, 1]`:

  - 1 for tokens that are **not masked**,
  - 0 for tokens that are **masked**.
- **past_key_values** (`~cache_utils.Cache`, *optional*) --
  Pre-computed hidden-states (key and values in the self-attention blocks and in the cross-attention
  blocks) that can be used to speed up sequential decoding. This typically consists in the `past_key_values`
  returned by the model at a previous stage of decoding, when `use_cache=True` or `config.use_cache=True`.

  Only [Cache](/docs/transformers/main/en/internal/generation_utils#transformers.Cache) instance is allowed as input, see our [kv cache guide](https://huggingface.co/docs/transformers/en/kv_cache).
  If no `past_key_values` are passed, [DynamicCache](/docs/transformers/main/en/internal/generation_utils#transformers.DynamicCache) will be initialized by default.

  The model will output the same cache format that is fed as input.

  If `past_key_values` are used, the user is expected to input only unprocessed `input_ids` (those that don't
  have their past key value states given to this model) of shape `(batch_size, unprocessed_length)` instead of all `input_ids`
  of shape `(batch_size, sequence_length)`.
- **use_cache** (`bool`, *optional*) --
  If set to `True`, `past_key_values` key value states are returned and can be used to speed up decoding (see
  `past_key_values`).
- **cache_position** (`torch.Tensor` of shape `(sequence_length)`, *optional*) --
  Indices depicting the position of the input sequence tokens in the sequence. Contrarily to `position_ids`,
  this tensor is not affected by padding. It is used to update the cache in the correct position and to infer
  the complete sequence length.0[transformers.modeling_outputs.BaseModelOutputWithPoolingAndCrossAttentions](/docs/transformers/main/en/main_classes/output#transformers.modeling_outputs.BaseModelOutputWithPoolingAndCrossAttentions) or `tuple(torch.FloatTensor)`A [transformers.modeling_outputs.BaseModelOutputWithPoolingAndCrossAttentions](/docs/transformers/main/en/main_classes/output#transformers.modeling_outputs.BaseModelOutputWithPoolingAndCrossAttentions) or a tuple of

- **pooler_output** (`torch.FloatTensor` of shape `(batch_size, hidden_size)`) -- Last layer hidden-state of the first token of the sequence (classification token) after further processing
  through the layers used for the auxiliary pretraining task. E.g. for BERT-family of models, this returns
  the classification token after processing through a linear layer and a tanh activation function. The linear
  layer weights are trained from the next sentence prediction (classification) objective during pretraining.
- **hidden_states** (`tuple(torch.FloatTensor)`, *optional*, returned when `output_hidden_states=True` is passed or when `config.output_hidden_states=True`) -- Tuple of `torch.FloatTensor` (one for the output of the embeddings, if the model has an embedding layer, +
  one for the output of each layer) of shape `(batch_size, sequence_length, hidden_size)`.

  sequence_length)`.

  Attentions weights after the attention softmax, used to compute the weighted average in the self-attention
  heads.
- **cross_attentions** (`tuple(torch.FloatTensor)`, *optional*, returned when `output_attentions=True` and `config.add_cross_attention=True` is passed or when `config.output_attentions=True`) -- Tuple of `torch.FloatTensor` (one for each layer) of shape `(batch_size, num_heads, sequence_length,
  sequence_length)`.

  Attentions weights of the decoder's cross-attention layer, after the attention softmax, used to compute the
  weighted average in the cross-attention heads.

For more details, see our [kv cache guide](https://huggingface.co/docs/transformers/en/kv_cache).

  Contains pre-computed hidden-states (key and values in the self-attention blocks and optionally if
  `config.is_encoder_decoder=True` in the cross-attention blocks) that can be used (see `past_key_values`
  input) to speed up sequential decoding.
The [CamembertModel](/docs/transformers/main/en/model_doc/camembert#transformers.CamembertModel) forward method, overrides the `__call__` special method.

Although the recipe for forward pass needs to be defined within this function, one should call the `Module`
instance afterwards instead of this since the former takes care of running the pre and post processing steps while
the latter silently ignores them.

**Parameters:**

config ([CamembertModel](/docs/transformers/main/en/model_doc/camembert#transformers.CamembertModel)) : Model configuration class with all the parameters of the model.
