# RoBERTa

[RoBERTa](https://huggingface.co/papers/1907.11692) improves BERT with new pretraining objectives, demonstrating [BERT](./bert) was undertrained and training design is important. The pretraining objectives include dynamic masking, sentence packing, larger batches and a byte-level BPE tokenizer.

You can find all the original RoBERTa checkpoints under the [Facebook AI](https://huggingface.co/FacebookAI) organization.

> [!TIP]
> Click on the RoBERTa models in the right sidebar for more examples of how to apply RoBERTa to different language tasks.

The example below demonstrates how to predict the `` token with [Pipeline](/docs/transformers/main/en/main_classes/pipelines#transformers.Pipeline), [AutoModel](/docs/transformers/main/en/model_doc/auto#transformers.AutoModel), and from the command line.

```py
import torch
from transformers import pipeline

pipeline = pipeline(
    task="fill-mask",
    model="FacebookAI/roberta-base",
    dtype=torch.float16,
    device=0
)
pipeline("Plants create  through a process known as photosynthesis.")
```

```py
import torch
from transformers import AutoModelForMaskedLM, AutoTokenizer

tokenizer = AutoTokenizer.from_pretrained(
    "FacebookAI/roberta-base",
)
model = AutoModelForMaskedLM.from_pretrained(
    "FacebookAI/roberta-base",
    dtype=torch.float16,
    device_map="auto",
    attn_implementation="sdpa"
)
inputs = tokenizer("Plants create  through a process known as photosynthesis.", return_tensors="pt").to(model.device)

with torch.no_grad():
    outputs = model(**inputs)
    predictions = outputs.logits

masked_index = torch.where(inputs['input_ids'] == tokenizer.mask_token_id)[1]
predicted_token_id = predictions[0, masked_index].argmax(dim=-1)
predicted_token = tokenizer.decode(predicted_token_id)

print(f"The predicted token is: {predicted_token}")
```

```bash
echo -e "Plants create  through a process known as photosynthesis." | transformers run --task fill-mask --model FacebookAI/roberta-base --device 0
```

## Notes

- RoBERTa doesn't have `token_type_ids` so you don't need to indicate which token belongs to which segment. Separate your segments with the separation token `tokenizer.sep_token` or ``.

## RobertaConfig[[transformers.RobertaConfig]]

#### transformers.RobertaConfig[[transformers.RobertaConfig]]

[Source](https://github.com/huggingface/transformers/blob/main/src/transformers/models/roberta/configuration_roberta.py#L25)

This is the configuration class to store the configuration of a [RobertaModel](/docs/transformers/main/en/model_doc/roberta#transformers.RobertaModel). It is
used to instantiate a RoBERTa model according to the specified arguments, defining the model architecture.
Instantiating a configuration with the defaults will yield a similar configuration to that of the RoBERTa
[FacebookAI/roberta-base](https://huggingface.co/FacebookAI/roberta-base) architecture.

Configuration objects inherit from [PreTrainedConfig](/docs/transformers/main/en/main_classes/configuration#transformers.PreTrainedConfig) and can be used to control the model outputs. Read the
documentation from [PreTrainedConfig](/docs/transformers/main/en/main_classes/configuration#transformers.PreTrainedConfig) for more information.

Examples:

```python
>>> from transformers import RobertaConfig, RobertaModel

>>> # Initializing a RoBERTa configuration
>>> configuration = RobertaConfig()

>>> # Initializing a model (with random weights) from the configuration
>>> model = RobertaModel(configuration)

>>> # Accessing the model configuration
>>> configuration = model.config
```

**Parameters:**

vocab_size (`int`, *optional*, defaults to 50265) : Vocabulary size of the RoBERTa model. Defines the number of different tokens that can be represented by the `inputs_ids` passed when calling [RobertaModel](/docs/transformers/main/en/model_doc/roberta#transformers.RobertaModel).

attention_probs_dropout_prob (`float`, *optional*, defaults to 0.1) : The dropout ratio for the attention probabilities.

max_position_embeddings (`int`, *optional*, defaults to 512) : The maximum sequence length that this model might ever be used with. Typically set this to something large just in case (e.g., 512 or 1024 or 2048).

type_vocab_size (`int`, *optional*, defaults to 2) : The vocabulary size of the `token_type_ids` passed when calling [RobertaModel](/docs/transformers/main/en/model_doc/roberta#transformers.RobertaModel).

## RobertaTokenizer[[transformers.RobertaTokenizer]]

#### transformers.RobertaTokenizer[[transformers.RobertaTokenizer]]

[Source](https://github.com/huggingface/transformers/blob/main/src/transformers/models/roberta/tokenization_roberta.py#L31)

Construct a RoBERTa tokenizer (backed by HuggingFace's tokenizers library). Based on Byte-Pair-Encoding.

This tokenizer has been trained to treat spaces like parts of the tokens (a bit like sentencepiece) so a word will

be encoded differently whether it is at the beginning of the sentence (without space) or not:

```python
>>> from transformers import RobertaTokenizer

>>> tokenizer = RobertaTokenizer.from_pretrained("FacebookAI/roberta-base")
>>> tokenizer("Hello world")["input_ids"]
[0, 31414, 232, 2]

>>> tokenizer(" Hello world")["input_ids"]
[0, 20920, 232, 2]
```

You can get around that behavior by passing `add_prefix_space=True` when instantiating this tokenizer or when you
call it on some text, but since the model was not pretrained this way, it might yield a decrease in performance.

When used with `is_split_into_words=True`, this tokenizer needs to be instantiated with `add_prefix_space=True`.

This tokenizer inherits from [TokenizersBackend](/docs/transformers/main/en/main_classes/tokenizer#transformers.TokenizersBackend) which contains most of the main methods. Users should refer to
this superclass for more information regarding those methods.

- **token_ids_1** -- Unused when `already_has_special_tokens=True`. Must be None in that case.
- **already_has_special_tokens** -- Whether the sequence is already formatted with special tokens.0A list of integers in the range [0, 1]1 for a special token, 0 for a sequence token.

Retrieve sequence ids from a token list that has no special tokens added.

For fast tokenizers, data collators call this with `already_has_special_tokens=True` to build a mask over an
already-formatted sequence. In that case, we compute the mask by checking membership in `all_special_ids`.

**Parameters:**

vocab (`str`, `dict` or `list`, *optional*) : Custom vocabulary dictionary. If not provided, vocabulary is loaded from vocab_file.

merges (`str` or `list`, *optional*) : Custom merges list. If not provided, merges are loaded from merges_file.

errors (`str`, *optional*, defaults to `"replace"`) : Paradigm to follow when decoding bytes to UTF-8. See [bytes.decode](https://docs.python.org/3/library/stdtypes.html#bytes.decode) for more information.

bos_token (`str`, *optional*, defaults to `""`) : The beginning of sequence token that was used during pretraining. Can be used a sequence classifier token.    When building a sequence using special tokens, this is not the token that is used for the beginning of sequence. The token used is the `cls_token`.   

eos_token (`str`, *optional*, defaults to `""`) : The end of sequence token.    When building a sequence using special tokens, this is not the token that is used for the end of sequence. The token used is the `sep_token`.   

sep_token (`str`, *optional*, defaults to `""`) : The separator token, which is used when building a sequence from multiple sequences, e.g. two sequences for sequence classification or for a text and a question for question answering. It is also used as the last token of a sequence built with special tokens.

cls_token (`str`, *optional*, defaults to `""`) : The classifier token which is used when doing sequence classification (classification of the whole sequence instead of per-token classification). It is the first token of the sequence when built with special tokens.

unk_token (`str`, *optional*, defaults to `""`) : The unknown token. A token that is not in the vocabulary cannot be converted to an ID and is set to be this token instead.

pad_token (`str`, *optional*, defaults to `""`) : The token used for padding, for example when batching sequences of different lengths.

mask_token (`str`, *optional*, defaults to `""`) : The token used for masking values. This is the token used when training this model with masked language modeling. This is the token which the model will try to predict.

add_prefix_space (`bool`, *optional*, defaults to `False`) : Whether or not to add an initial space to the input. This allows to treat the leading word just as any other word. (RoBERTa tokenizer detect beginning of words by the preceding space).

trim_offsets (`bool`, *optional*, defaults to `True`) : Whether the post processing step should trim offsets to avoid including whitespaces.

**Returns:**

`A list of integers in the range [0, 1]`

1 for a special token, 0 for a sequence token.

## RobertaModel[[transformers.RobertaModel]]

#### transformers.RobertaModel[[transformers.RobertaModel]]

[Source](https://github.com/huggingface/transformers/blob/main/src/transformers/models/roberta/modeling_roberta.py#L567)

The model can behave as an encoder (with only self-attention) as well as a decoder, in which case a layer of
cross-attention is added between the self-attention layers, following the architecture described in [Attention is
all you need](https://huggingface.co/papers/1706.03762) by Ashish Vaswani, Noam Shazeer, Niki Parmar, Jakob Uszkoreit,
Llion Jones, Aidan N. Gomez, Lukasz Kaiser and Illia Polosukhin.

To behave as an decoder the model needs to be initialized with the `is_decoder` argument of the configuration set
to `True`. To be used in a Seq2Seq model, the model needs to initialized with both `is_decoder` argument and
`add_cross_attention` set to `True`; an `encoder_hidden_states` is then expected as an input to the forward pass.

This model inherits from [PreTrainedModel](/docs/transformers/main/en/main_classes/model#transformers.PreTrainedModel). Check the superclass documentation for the generic methods the
library implements for all its model (such as downloading or saving, resizing the input embeddings, pruning heads
etc.)

This model is also a PyTorch [torch.nn.Module](https://pytorch.org/docs/stable/nn.html#torch.nn.Module) subclass.
Use it as a regular PyTorch Module and refer to the PyTorch documentation for all matter related to general usage
and behavior.

  Indices of input sequence tokens in the vocabulary. Padding will be ignored by default.

  Indices can be obtained using [AutoTokenizer](/docs/transformers/main/en/model_doc/auto#transformers.AutoTokenizer). See [PreTrainedTokenizer.encode()](/docs/transformers/main/en/internal/tokenization_utils#transformers.PreTrainedTokenizerBase.encode) and
  [PreTrainedTokenizer.__call__()](/docs/transformers/main/en/internal/tokenization_utils#transformers.PreTrainedTokenizerBase.__call__) for details.

  [What are input IDs?](../glossary#input-ids)
- **attention_mask** (`torch.Tensor` of shape `(batch_size, sequence_length)`, *optional*) --
  Mask to avoid performing attention on padding token indices. Mask values selected in `[0, 1]`:

  - 1 for tokens that are **not masked**,
  - 0 for tokens that are **masked**.

  [What are attention masks?](../glossary#attention-mask)
- **token_type_ids** (`torch.Tensor` of shape `(batch_size, sequence_length)`, *optional*) --
  Segment token indices to indicate first and second portions of the inputs. Indices are selected in `[0, 1]`:

  - 0 corresponds to a *sentence A* token,
  - 1 corresponds to a *sentence B* token.

  [What are token type IDs?](../glossary#token-type-ids)
- **position_ids** (`torch.Tensor` of shape `(batch_size, sequence_length)`, *optional*) --
  Indices of positions of each input sequence tokens in the position embeddings. Selected in the range `[0, config.n_positions - 1]`.

  [What are position IDs?](../glossary#position-ids)
- **inputs_embeds** (`torch.Tensor` of shape `(batch_size, sequence_length, hidden_size)`, *optional*) --
  Optionally, instead of passing `input_ids` you can choose to directly pass an embedded representation. This
  is useful if you want more control over how to convert `input_ids` indices into associated vectors than the
  model's internal embedding lookup matrix.
- **encoder_hidden_states** (`torch.Tensor` of shape `(batch_size, sequence_length, hidden_size)`, *optional*) --
  Sequence of hidden-states at the output of the last layer of the encoder. Used in the cross-attention
  if the model is configured as a decoder.
- **encoder_attention_mask** (`torch.Tensor` of shape `(batch_size, sequence_length)`, *optional*) --
  Mask to avoid performing attention on the padding token indices of the encoder input. This mask is used in
  the cross-attention if the model is configured as a decoder. Mask values selected in `[0, 1]`:

  - 1 for tokens that are **not masked**,
  - 0 for tokens that are **masked**.
- **past_key_values** (`~cache_utils.Cache`, *optional*) --
  Pre-computed hidden-states (key and values in the self-attention blocks and in the cross-attention
  blocks) that can be used to speed up sequential decoding. This typically consists in the `past_key_values`
  returned by the model at a previous stage of decoding, when `use_cache=True` or `config.use_cache=True`.

  Only [Cache](/docs/transformers/main/en/internal/generation_utils#transformers.Cache) instance is allowed as input, see our [kv cache guide](https://huggingface.co/docs/transformers/en/kv_cache).
  If no `past_key_values` are passed, [DynamicCache](/docs/transformers/main/en/internal/generation_utils#transformers.DynamicCache) will be initialized by default.

  The model will output the same cache format that is fed as input.

  If `past_key_values` are used, the user is expected to input only unprocessed `input_ids` (those that don't
  have their past key value states given to this model) of shape `(batch_size, unprocessed_length)` instead of all `input_ids`
  of shape `(batch_size, sequence_length)`.
- **use_cache** (`bool`, *optional*) --
  If set to `True`, `past_key_values` key value states are returned and can be used to speed up decoding (see
  `past_key_values`).
- **cache_position** (`torch.Tensor` of shape `(sequence_length)`, *optional*) --
  Indices depicting the position of the input sequence tokens in the sequence. Contrarily to `position_ids`,
  this tensor is not affected by padding. It is used to update the cache in the correct position and to infer
  the complete sequence length.0[transformers.modeling_outputs.BaseModelOutputWithPoolingAndCrossAttentions](/docs/transformers/main/en/main_classes/output#transformers.modeling_outputs.BaseModelOutputWithPoolingAndCrossAttentions) or `tuple(torch.FloatTensor)`A [transformers.modeling_outputs.BaseModelOutputWithPoolingAndCrossAttentions](/docs/transformers/main/en/main_classes/output#transformers.modeling_outputs.BaseModelOutputWithPoolingAndCrossAttentions) or a tuple of

elements depending on the configuration ([RobertaConfig](/docs/transformers/main/en/model_doc/roberta#transformers.RobertaConfig)) and inputs.

- **last_hidden_state** (`torch.FloatTensor` of shape `(batch_size, sequence_length, hidden_size)`) -- Sequence of hidden-states at the output of the last layer of the model.
- **pooler_output** (`torch.FloatTensor` of shape `(batch_size, hidden_size)`) -- Last layer hidden-state of the first token of the sequence (classification token) after further processing
  through the layers used for the auxiliary pretraining task. E.g. for BERT-family of models, this returns
  the classification token after processing through a linear layer and a tanh activation function. The linear
  layer weights are trained from the next sentence prediction (classification) objective during pretraining.
- **hidden_states** (`tuple(torch.FloatTensor)`, *optional*, returned when `output_hidden_states=True` is passed or when `config.output_hidden_states=True`) -- Tuple of `torch.FloatTensor` (one for the output of the embeddings, if the model has an embedding layer, +
  one for the output of each layer) of shape `(batch_size, sequence_length, hidden_size)`.

  sequence_length)`.

  Attentions weights after the attention softmax, used to compute the weighted average in the self-attention

  sequence_length)`.

  Attentions weights of the decoder's cross-attention layer, after the attention softmax, used to compute the
  weighted average in the cross-attention heads.

  Contains pre-computed hidden-states (key and values in the self-attention blocks and optionally if
  `config.is_encoder_decoder=True` in the cross-attention blocks) that can be used (see `past_key_values`
  input) to speed up sequential decoding.
The [RobertaModel](/docs/transformers/main/en/model_doc/roberta#transformers.RobertaModel) forward method, overrides the `__call__` special method.

Although the recipe for forward pass needs to be defined within this function, one should call the `Module`
instance afterwards instead of this since the former takes care of running the pre and post processing steps while
the latter silently ignores them.

**Parameters:**
