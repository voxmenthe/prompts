# BigBird

[BigBird](https://huggingface.co/papers/2007.14062) is a transformer model built to handle sequence lengths up to 4096 compared to 512 for [BERT](./bert). Traditional transformers struggle with long inputs because attention gets really expensive as the sequence length grows. BigBird fixes this by using a sparse attention mechanism, which means it doesn’t try to look at everything at once. Instead, it mixes in local attention, random attention, and a few global tokens to process the whole input. This combination gives it the best of both worlds. It keeps the computation efficient while still capturing enough of the sequence to understand it well. Because of this, BigBird is great at tasks involving long documents, like question answering, summarization, and genomic applications.

You can find all the original BigBird checkpoints under the [Google](https://huggingface.co/google?search_models=bigbird) organization.

The example below demonstrates how to predict the `[MASK]` token with [Pipeline](/docs/transformers/main/en/main_classes/pipelines#transformers.Pipeline), [AutoModel](/docs/transformers/main/en/model_doc/auto#transformers.AutoModel), and from the command line.

```py
import torch
from transformers import pipeline

pipeline = pipeline(
    task="fill-mask",
    model="google/bigbird-roberta-base",
    dtype=torch.float16,
    device=0
)
pipeline("Plants create [MASK] through a process known as photosynthesis.")
```

```py
import torch
from transformers import AutoModelForMaskedLM, AutoTokenizer

tokenizer = AutoTokenizer.from_pretrained(
    "google/bigbird-roberta-base",
)
model = AutoModelForMaskedLM.from_pretrained(
    "google/bigbird-roberta-base",
    dtype=torch.float16,
    device_map="auto",
)
inputs = tokenizer("Plants create [MASK] through a process known as photosynthesis.", return_tensors="pt").to(model.device)

with torch.no_grad():
    outputs = model(**inputs)
    predictions = outputs.logits

masked_index = torch.where(inputs['input_ids'] == tokenizer.mask_token_id)[1]
predicted_token_id = predictions[0, masked_index].argmax(dim=-1)
predicted_token = tokenizer.decode(predicted_token_id)

print(f"The predicted token is: {predicted_token}")
```

```bash
!echo -e "Plants create [MASK] through a process known as photosynthesis." | transformers run --task fill-mask --model google/bigbird-roberta-base --device 0
```

## Notes

- Inputs should be padded on the right because BigBird uses absolute position embeddings.
- BigBird supports `original_full` and `block_sparse` attention. If the input sequence length is less than 1024, it is recommended to use `original_full` since sparse patterns don't offer much benefit for smaller inputs.
- The current implementation uses window size of 3 blocks and 2 global blocks, only supports the ITC-implementation, and doesn't support `num_random_blocks=0`.
- The sequence length must be divisible by the block size.

This is the configuration class to store the configuration of a [BigBirdModel](/docs/transformers/main/en/model_doc/big_bird#transformers.BigBirdModel). It is used to instantiate an
BigBird model according to the specified arguments, defining the model architecture. Instantiating a configuration
with the defaults will yield a similar configuration to that of the BigBird
[google/bigbird-roberta-base](https://huggingface.co/google/bigbird-roberta-base) architecture.

Configuration objects inherit from [PreTrainedConfig](/docs/transformers/main/en/main_classes/configuration#transformers.PreTrainedConfig) and can be used to control the model outputs. Read the
documentation from [PreTrainedConfig](/docs/transformers/main/en/main_classes/configuration#transformers.PreTrainedConfig) for more information.

Example:

```python
>>> from transformers import BigBirdConfig, BigBirdModel

>>> # Initializing a BigBird google/bigbird-roberta-base style configuration
>>> configuration = BigBirdConfig()

>>> # Initializing a model (with random weights) from the google/bigbird-roberta-base style configuration

This model inherits from [PreTrainedModel](/docs/transformers/main/en/main_classes/model#transformers.PreTrainedModel). Check the superclass documentation for the generic methods the
library implements for all its model (such as downloading or saving, resizing the input embeddings, pruning heads
etc.)

This model is also a PyTorch [torch.nn.Module](https://pytorch.org/docs/stable/nn.html#torch.nn.Module) subclass.
Use it as a regular PyTorch Module and refer to the PyTorch documentation for all matter related to general usage
and behavior.

  Indices of input sequence tokens in the vocabulary. Padding will be ignored by default.

  Indices can be obtained using [AutoTokenizer](/docs/transformers/main/en/model_doc/auto#transformers.AutoTokenizer). See [PreTrainedTokenizer.encode()](/docs/transformers/main/en/internal/tokenization_utils#transformers.PreTrainedTokenizerBase.encode) and

- **token_type_ids** (`torch.LongTensor` of shape `(batch_size, sequence_length)`, *optional*) --
  Segment token indices to indicate first and second portions of the inputs. Indices are selected in `[0, 1]`:

  - 0 corresponds to a *sentence A* token,

  The model will output the same cache format that is fed as input.

  If `past_key_values` are used, the user is expected to input only unprocessed `input_ids` (those that don't
  have their past key value states given to this model) of shape `(batch_size, unprocessed_length)` instead of all `input_ids`
  of shape `(batch_size, sequence_length)`.

  this tensor is not affected by padding. It is used to update the cache in the correct position and to infer
  the complete sequence length.0[transformers.modeling_outputs.BaseModelOutputWithPoolingAndCrossAttentions](/docs/transformers/main/en/main_classes/output#transformers.modeling_outputs.BaseModelOutputWithPoolingAndCrossAttentions) or `tuple(torch.FloatTensor)`A [transformers.modeling_outputs.BaseModelOutputWithPoolingAndCrossAttentions](/docs/transformers/main/en/main_classes/output#transformers.modeling_outputs.BaseModelOutputWithPoolingAndCrossAttentions) or a tuple of

  `config.is_encoder_decoder=True` in the cross-attention blocks) that can be used (see `past_key_values`
  input) to speed up sequential decoding.
The [BigBirdModel](/docs/transformers/main/en/model_doc/big_bird#transformers.BigBirdModel) forward method, overrides the `__call__` special method.

Although the recipe for forward pass needs to be defined within this function, one should call the `Module`
instance afterwards instead of this since the former takes care of running the pre and post processing steps while
the latter silently ignores them.

**Parameters:**

config ([BigBirdModel](/docs/transformers/main/en/model_doc/big_bird#transformers.BigBirdModel)) : Model configuration class with all the parameters of the model.

This model inherits from [PreTrainedModel](/docs/transformers/main/en/main_classes/model#transformers.PreTrainedModel). Check the superclass documentation for the generic methods the
library implements for all its model (such as downloading or saving, resizing the input embeddings, pruning heads
etc.)

This model is also a PyTorch [torch.nn.Module](https://pytorch.org/docs/stable/nn.html#torch.nn.Module) subclass.
Use it as a regular PyTorch Module and refer to the PyTorch documentation for all matter related to general usage
and behavior.

  model's internal embedding lookup matrix.
- **encoder_hidden_states** (`torch.FloatTensor` of shape `(batch_size, sequence_length, hidden_size)`, *optional*) --
  Sequence of hidden-states at the output of the last layer of the encoder. Used in the cross-attention
  if the model is configured as a decoder.
- **encoder_attention_mask** (`torch.FloatTensor` of shape `(batch_size, sequence_length)`, *optional*) --
  Mask to avoid performing attention on the padding token indices of the encoder input. This mask is used in
  the cross-attention if the model is configured as a decoder. Mask values selected in `[0, 1]`:

  - 1 for tokens that are **not masked**,
  - 0 for tokens that are **masked**.
- **past_key_values** (`~cache_utils.Cache`, *optional*) --
  Pre-computed hidden-states (key and values in the self-attention blocks and in the cross-attention
  blocks) that can be used to speed up sequential decoding. This typically consists in the `past_key_values`
  returned by the model at a previous stage of decoding, when `use_cache=True` or `config.use_cache=True`.

  Only [Cache](/docs/transformers/main/en/internal/generation_utils#transformers.Cache) instance is allowed as input, see our [kv cache guide](https://huggingface.co/docs/transformers/en/kv_cache).
  If no `past_key_values` are passed, [DynamicCache](/docs/transformers/main/en/internal/generation_utils#transformers.DynamicCache) will be initialized by default.

  The model will output the same cache format that is fed as input.

  If `past_key_values` are used, the user is expected to input only unprocessed `input_ids` (those that don't
  have their past key value states given to this model) of shape `(batch_size, unprocessed_length)` instead of all `input_ids`
  of shape `(batch_size, sequence_length)`.

  tensors for more detail.

  Whether or not to return the hidden states of all layers. See `hidden_states` under returned tensors for
  more detail.
- **return_dict** (`bool`, *optional*) --
  Whether or not to return a [ModelOutput](/docs/transformers/main/en/main_classes/output#transformers.utils.ModelOutput) instead of a plain tuple.
- **cache_position** (`torch.Tensor` of shape `(sequence_length)`, *optional*) --
  Indices depicting the position of the input sequence tokens in the sequence. Contrarily to `position_ids`,
  this tensor is not affected by padding. It is used to update the cache in the correct position and to infer
  the complete sequence length.
- **logits_to_keep** (`Union[int, torch.Tensor]`, defaults to `0`) --
  If an `int`, compute logits for the last `logits_to_keep` tokens. If `0`, calculate logits for all
  `input_ids` (special case). Only last token logits are needed for generation, and calculating them only for that
  token can save memory, which becomes pretty significant for long sequences or large vocabulary size.
  If a `torch.Tensor`, must be 1D corresponding to the indices to keep in the sequence length dimension.
  This is useful when using packed tensor format (single dimension for batch and sequence length).0[transformers.modeling_outputs.CausalLMOutputWithCrossAttentions](/docs/transformers/main/en/main_classes/output#transformers.modeling_outputs.CausalLMOutputWithCrossAttentions) or `tuple(torch.FloatTensor)`A [transformers.modeling_outputs.CausalLMOutputWithCrossAttentions](/docs/transformers/main/en/main_classes/output#transformers.modeling_outputs.CausalLMOutputWithCrossAttentions) or a tuple of

The Big Bird transformer with a token classification head on top (a linear layer on top of the hidden-states
output) e.g. for Named-Entity-Recognition (NER) tasks.

This model inherits from [PreTrainedModel](/docs/transformers/main/en/main_classes/model#transformers.PreTrainedModel). Check the superclass documentation for the generic methods the
library implements for all its model (such as downloading or saving, resizing the input embeddings, pruning heads
etc.)

This model is also a PyTorch [torch.nn.Module](https://pytorch.org/docs/stable/nn.html#torch.nn.Module) subclass.
Use it as a regular PyTorch Module and refer to the PyTorch documentation for all matter related to general usage
and behavior.

Although the recipe for forward pass needs to be defined within this function, one should call the `Module`
instance afterwards instead of this since the former takes care of running the pre and post processing steps while
the latter silently ignores them.

>>> predicted_token_class_ids = logits.argmax(-1)

>>> # Note that tokens are classified rather then input words which means that
>>> # there might be more predicted token classes than words.
