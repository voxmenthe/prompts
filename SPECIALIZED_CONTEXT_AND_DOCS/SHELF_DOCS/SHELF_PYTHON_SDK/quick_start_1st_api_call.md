# Quick Start: Making 1st API call

## First API Call Using Shelf Content Intelligence Python SDK

Welcome to the quick start guide for getting up and running with the Shelf Content Intelligence Python SDK. In just a few steps, learn how to perform API calls to access and analyze your content like never before!

## Tutorial Colab notebook

We encourage you to explore the package with our [Tutorial Colab notebook](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1srG2Lih8xbEit50rJ_M1hhedGdB_dhxL?usp=sharing), which showcases the package in action.

### Prerequisites

Before we dive in, make sure you have the following ready:

* A Python environment is set up on your machine.
* Access credentials for Shelf Content Intelligence, including a Shelf API token.
* The Shelf Content Intelligence Python SDK is installed in your environment.

If you need some pointers on setting these up, consider checking out the following guides:

* [Setting Up Shelf API Token](https://github.com/shelfio/shelf-dev-portal/blob/master/gitbook/content-intelligence/README.md)
* [Installing Shelf Content Intelligence Python SDK](installation-and-making-1st-api-call)

### Setting Up Your Environment

#### 1. Prepare Environment Variables

For a smooth start, ensure you have a `.env` file in your project's root directory with the following content:

```plaintext
SHELF_API_TOKEN=your_api_token_here
SHELF_API_URL=https://your_api_url_here
```

This step stores your API token and URL securely.

**Note:** Ensure that the environment `.env` file does not have quotation marks `"`.

\- `SHELF_API_TOKEN="EXAMPLE_TOKEN"` - <mark style="color:red;">incorrect</mark>

\- `SHELF_API_TOKEN=EXAMPLE_TOKEN`- <mark style="color:green;">correct</mark>

#### 2. Manage Environment Variables Easily

The `python-dotenv`package comes in handy to manage your environmental variables conveniently. Install it by entering in your terminal:

```bash
pip install python-dotenv
```

#### 3. Initialize the SDK

With your environment variables set, it's time to initialize the `ContentIntelligenceClient` object. Here's how you do it in your Python code:

```python
from dotenv import load_dotenv
from shelf.ci.client import ContentIntelligenceClient

# Load environment variables
load_dotenv()

# Initialize Shelf Content Intelligence SDK
ci = ContentIntelligenceClient()
```

Alternatively, you can pass the `token` and `api_url` directly:

```python
# Initialize Shelf Content Intelligence SDK with explicit token and URL
ci = ContentIntelligenceClient(token="SHELF_API_TOKEN", api_url="https://SHELF_API_URL")
```

### Example API Call: Listing Content Items

Now, let's explore how we can use the SDK to list content items based on a specific criterion.

#### Fetch and Print Content Items

Imagine you need a list of content items. You can accomplish this using the `ci.content_items.list()` method as shown below:

```python
# List all content items
content_items = ci.content_items.list()

# Iterate and print each content item's details
for item in content_items:
    print(item)
```

This snippet fetches content items and prints the details of each item in a readable format.

### Advanced: Perform Custom REST Requests

While the Python SDK is comprehensive, you might occasionally need to perform REST requests directlyâ€”for functionality not yet available in the SDK or for specialized requests.

```python
# Assuming environment variables and the `ContentIntelligenceClient` object (ci) are already set up as before

# Example of performing a custom POST request
search_query = "How to build powerful RAG pipelines?"

result = ci.client.post(
    path="/cil-search/content/semantic-sections",
    json={
        "query": search_query,
        "size": 5,
        "origin": "shelf",
        "format": "markdown",
        "sortBy": "RELEVANCE",
        "sortOrder": "DESC",
    }
)
```

This snippet showcases how you can conduct a custom POST request to the Shelf Content Intelligence REST API, potentially expanding the use cases you can handle with the SDK.
