Installing GSAP for use with custom code.

<br />

All GSAP files can now be included directly from Webflow's settings, making it nice and easy to get started and make something amazing.

### Installing GSAP

1. Go to your site in Webflow

2. Go to the **settings** panel

3. Click **GSAP integration**

4. Toggle **on** to include the core GSAP library & use the checkboxes to enable plugins.

### Adding Custom Code

1. OpenÂ **Page settings**Â for the page where youâ€™d like to add your code

2. In the UI find theÂ **Before** `</body>` tagÂ section underÂ **Custom code**

   ![](/assets/images/bodytag-e7c8b2fd0e121058fd4baf0a0c3325fd.png)

3. Ensure that you wrap your GSAP code in a script tag, and a `DOMContentLoaded` event listener.

   ```
   <script>
   addEventListener("DOMContentLoaded", (e) => {

     gsap.to('.my-element', {
      rotation: 360,
      duration: 2,
      ease: 'bounce.out'
     })

   });
   </script>
   ```

4. If you're adding plugins, remember to register them!

   ```
     gsap.registerPlugin(SplitText) 

     let split = SplitText.create(".text", {type: "chars, words"});

     gsap.from(split.chars, {
     	duration: 1, 
     	y: 100, 
     	autoAlpha: 0, 
     	stagger: 0.05
       });
   ```

Per page script loading

Currently the Webflow GSAP integration loads GSAP and the plugins on a site-wide level.

If you would rather load GSAP or a specific plugin on a per page basis we recommend using a script tag along with your JS in the page settings.
