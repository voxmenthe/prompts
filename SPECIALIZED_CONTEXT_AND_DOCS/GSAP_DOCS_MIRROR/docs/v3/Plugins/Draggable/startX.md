### Details[â€‹](#details "Direct link to Details")

\[read-only] The starting `x` (horizontal) position of the Draggable instance when the most recent drag began. For a Draggable of `type: "x,y"`, it would be the `x` transform translation, as in the CSS `transform: translateX(...)`. For `type: "top,left"`, the Draggable's `x` would refer to the CSS `left` value that's applied. For `type: "rotation"` it's the rotation (in degrees). This is not the global coordinate - it is the inline CSS-related value applied to the element.
