### Details[â€‹](#details "Direct link to Details")

*Number* - The `y` (vertical) position of the pointer (mouse or touch) associated with the Draggable's last event (like `event.pageY`). In most cases, this should be used instead of using the event's `.pageY` because GSAP tries to normalize positioning across all browsers.
