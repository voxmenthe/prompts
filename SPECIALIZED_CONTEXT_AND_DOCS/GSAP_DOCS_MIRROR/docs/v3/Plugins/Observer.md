# Observer

Quick Start

#### CDN Link

Copy

```
gsap.registerPlugin(Observer) 
```

#### Minimal usage

```
Observer.create({
  target: window, // can be any element (selector text is fine)
  type: "wheel,touch", // comma-delimited list of what to listen for
  onUp: () => previous(),
  onDown: () => next(),
});
```

Super-flexible, unified way to sense meaningful events across all (touch/mouse/pointer) devices without wrestling with all the implementation details. Perhaps you want to respond to "scroll-like" user behavior which could be a mouse wheel spin, finger swipe on a touch device, a scrollbar drag, or a pointer press & drag...and of course you need directional data and velocity. No problem!

Detailed Walkthrough

[YouTube video player](https://www.youtube.com/embed/spW7GsvQ_y0)

Tell Observer which event types to watch (wheel, touch, pointer, and/or scroll) and it will collect delta values over the course of each requestAnimationFrame tick ([debounced](https://css-tricks.com/debouncing-throttling-explained-examples/) for performance by default) and automatically determine the biggest delta and then trigger the appropriate callback(s) like `onUp`, `onDown`, `onDrag`, etc. (see the full list below).

Look how easy it is to trigger next()/previous() functions based on when the user swipes up/down or uses their mouse wheel:

```
Observer.create({
  target: window, // can be any element (selector text is fine)
  type: "wheel,touch", // comma-delimited list of what to listen for ("wheel,touch,scroll,pointer")
  onUp: () => previous(),
  onDown: () => next(),
});
```

### Observer is included in ScrollTrigger too\![â€‹](#observer-is-included-in-scrolltrigger-too "Direct link to Observer is included in ScrollTrigger too!")

There's a [ScrollTrigger.observe()](/docs/v3/Plugins/ScrollTrigger/static.observe\(\).md) method that's identical to `Observer.create()`. Since ScrollTrigger's [normalizeScroll()](/docs/v3/Plugins/ScrollTrigger/static.normalizeScroll\(\).md) functionality leverages Observer under the hood (thus it's included inside ScrollTrigger anyway), it made sense to expose its functionality so that you can avoid loading Observer as a separate file if you're already using ScrollTrigger in your project. You're welcome. ðŸ™‚

## Demo[â€‹](#demo "Direct link to Demo")

Notice there's no actual scrolling in the demo below but you can use your mouse wheel (or swipe on touch devices) to initiate movement so it "feels" like a scroll:

Feature Highlights

* **Rich callback system** including onDown, onUp, onLeft, onRight, onDrag, onDragStart, onDragEnd, onHover, onHoverEnd, onToggleY, onToggleX, onChangeX, onChangeY, onChange, onClick, onPress, onRelease, onMove, onWheel, and onStop
* **Debounced** by default for maximum performance (you can set `debounce: false` if you prefer)
* **Cross-browser compatible** - automatically senses if TouchEvents, PointerEvents, or MouseEvents should be used.
* Automatically prioritizes the event with the **largest delta** (like if a wheel and scroll and touch event all occur during the same debounced period)

**read more...**

* Ignore certain elements, like `ignore: ".deadzone"`
* Get **velocity** (on x and y axis separately) as well as the clientX and clientY coordinates (for touch/pointer events)
* Set a **minimum threshold for dragging**. For example, dragMinimum: 5 would only fire the onDragStart/onDrag/onDragEnd callbacks if the user moved 5 pixels or more.
* Set a **tolerance** so that the movement-related callbacks only fire when a minimum delta is reached, so `tolerance: 50` would wait until there has been a change of at least 50 pixels, and then once that's reached it starts over.
* Set a **wheelSpeed** multiplier if you'd like to tweak the wheel-related deltas (speed them up or slow them down).
* Integrated with GSAP and [ScrollTrigger](/docs/v3/Plugins/ScrollTrigger/.md)
* Roughly **3.5kb gzipped**

## **Config Object**[â€‹](#config-object "Direct link to config-object")

The configuration object that is passed to `Observer.create()` can have any of the following optional properties:

* ### Property

  ### Description

  #### axis[](#axis)

  string - when `lockAxis: true` is set, the first drag movement (with type: "pointer" and/or "touch") after each press will set the `axis` property to "x" or "y", depending on which direction the user moved. You can use the `onLockAxis()` callback to know when it gets set.

* #### capture[](#capture)

  Boolean - if `true`, it will make the touch/pointer-related listeners use the capture phase. Like doing addEventListener("\[type]", func, {capture: true});

* #### debounce[](#debounce)

  Boolean - by default, Observer will debounce events so that deltas are additive over the course of each requestAnimationFrame() tick in order to maximize performance, but you can disable that with `debounce: false` in which case it will check immediately on every event. The debounce affects all callbacks except `onPress`, `onRelease`, `onHover`, `onHoverEnd`, `onClick`, `onDragStart`, and `onDragEnd` because those aren't delta-related.

* #### dragMinimum[](#dragMinimum)

  Number - the minimum distance (in pixels) necessary to be considered "dragging". This can help prevent tiny motions especially on touch devices from indicating intent. For example, just pressing down with a finger on a phone may register slight movement of a few pixels even though the user thinks their finger was stationary. dragMinimum only applies to the initial movement after pressing down, but continued dragging thereafter would only be subject to "tolerance" throttling.

* #### id[](#id)

  String - an arbitrary string ID which an be used to get the Observer via [Observer.getById()](/docs/v3/Plugins/Observer/static.getById\(\).md).

* #### ignore[](#ignore)

  Element | String | Array - elements that you'd like the observer to **IGNORE**, so that when a scroll/touch/pointer/mouse event is triggered by one of these elements, it gets ignored completely. It checks the `event.target` to discern if the event should be ignored. You can define `ignore` as an Element reference, selector text like `".ignore-me"`, or an Array of elements (it can be as many as you'd like).

* #### lockAxis[](#lockAxis)

  Boolean - if `true`, the Observer will watch the direction of the very first drag move after each press (with type: "pointer" and/or "touch") and lock into that direction until the user releases the pointer/touch. So if the first drag is horizontal, then only the horizontal-related callbacks like `onChangeX()` will fire until the pointer/touch is released. There's even an `onLockAxis()` callback that you can tie into.

* #### onChange[](#onChange)

  Function - function to call when there is movement on **either** the y-axis (vertically) **or** the x-axis (horizontally). It will keep calling the function as long as the movement continues (subject to any tolerance threshold).

* #### onChangeX[](#onChangeX)

  Function - function to call when there is movement on the x-axis (horizontally). It will keep calling the function as long as the movement continues (subject to any tolerance threshold).

* #### onChangeY[](#onChangeY)

  Function - function to call when there is movement on the y-axis (vertically). It will keep calling the function as long as the movement continues (subject to any tolerance threshold).

* #### onClick[](#onClick)

  Function - function to call when the target is clicked.

* #### onDown[](#onDown)

  Function - function to call when downward motion is detected, meaning the delta values increase (like dragging your finger/mouse DOWNWARD...which makes the `y` coordinate *increase*). If you want to invert only the mouse wheel delta, you can set `wheelSpeed: -1` because it's a multiplier.

* #### onDragStart[](#onDragStart)

  Function - function to call when the user presses down on the target and then begins dragging (subject to `dragMinimum`). This only applies to "touch" and/or "pointer" types.

* #### onDrag[](#onDrag)

  Function - function to call when the user moves the pointer/touch/mouse **while pressing** on the target element (only applies to "touch" and/or "pointer" types).

* #### onDragEnd[](#onDragEnd)

  Function - function to call when the user stops dragging on the target element (only applies to "touch" and/or "pointer" types).

* #### onLeft[](#onLeft)

  Function - function to call when motion is detected toward the left direction.

* #### onLockAxis[](#onLockAxis)

  Function - function to call when the axis gets locked (requires `lockAxis: true`). You can check which axis via the Observer's `axis` property ("x" or "y").

* #### onHover[](#onHover)

  Function - function to call when the pointer/mouse hovers over the target ("pointerenter"/"mouseenter" event).

* #### onHoverEnd[](#onHoverEnd)

  Function - function to call when the pointer/mouse moves off the target ("pointerleave"/"mouseleave" event).

* #### onMove[](#onMove)

  Function - function to call when the user moves the pointer/mouse while hovered over the target element (only applies to "pointer" types). It listens for "pointermove"/"mousemove" events internally. Use `onDrag` if you want it to fire only while pressing and dragging. Note that when you define an onMove, it causes the Observer to measure delta values **while hovering** over the target, consequently triggering the appropriate movement-related callbacks like onUp, onDown, onChange, etc. for any pointer/mouse movement while over the target. Normally the movement-related callbacks are only triggered when the user **presses and drags**.

* #### onPress[](#onPress)

  Function - function to call when the user presses down on the target element (only applies to "touch" and/or "pointer" types).

* #### onRelease[](#onRelease)

  Function - function to call when the touch/pointer is released after the `onPress` was called (only applies to "touch" and/or "pointer" types).

* #### onRight[](#onRight)

  Function - function to call when motion is detected toward the right direction.

* #### onStop[](#onStop)

  Function - function to call when changes have ceased for at least 0.25 seconds (configurable with `onStopDelay`)

* #### onStopDelay[](#onStopDelay)

  Number - number of seconds to wait after changes have ceased firing before the `onStop` gets called (default: 0.25 seconds).

* #### onToggleX[](#onToggleX)

  Function - function to call when motion **switches direction** on the x-axis (horizontally).

* #### onToggleY[](#onToggleY)

  Function - function to call when motion **switches direction** on the y-axis (vertically).

* #### onUp[](#onUp)

  Function - function to call when upward motion is detected, meaning the delta values decrease (like dragging your finger/mouse UPWARD...which makes the `y` coordinate decrease). If you want to invert only the mouse wheel delta, you can set `wheelSpeed: -1` because it's a multiplier.

* #### onWheel[](#onWheel)

  Function - function to call when the mouse wheel is used.

* #### scrollSpeed[](#scrollSpeed)

  Number - a multiplier for scroll delta values. This only applies to type `"scroll"`, meaning when the target dispatches a scroll event which is different than a wheel event. You could set `scrollSpeed: -1` to invert the delta values and have it call `onUp` instead of `onDown` (and vice versa). `scrollSpeed: 0.5` would make the delta values *half* of what they'd normally be. *Note: there's also a separate&#x20;*`wheelSpeed`*&#x20;option that only applies to wheel events.*

* #### target[](#target)

  Element | String - the element whose events should be listened for. By default, it's the main viewport.

* #### tolerance[](#tolerance)

  Number - the minimum distance (in pixels) necessary to trigger one of the callbacks like `onUp`, `onDown`, `onChangeY`, etc. So, for example, if the tolerance is 10 but the user only moves 8 pixels, no callback will be fired. Once the distance exceeds the tolerance amount, it fires the callbacks and resets, waiting for that distance to be exceeded again before firing the callback(s).

* #### type[](#type)

  String - a comma-delimited list of the types of actions you'd like to listen for which can include any (or all) of the following: `"wheel,touch,scroll,pointer"`. "touch" works on any touch devices regardless of browser (iOS/Android may use TouchEvents under the hood whereas Microsoft may use PointerEvents but Observer includes them both in "touch"). "pointer" covers any non-touch pointer/mouse press/drag/swipe movements. "wheel" is for mouse wheel movements, and "scroll" is for scroll events. *Default is* `"wheel,touch,pointer"`

* #### wheelSpeed[](#wheelSpeed)

  Number - a multiplier for wheel delta values. By default, it merely passes along the wheel event's delta that the browser reports but perhaps it seems faster/slower than when you press/drag with the pointer and you need a way to make them more similar. To make the wheel delta values half of what they normally are, for example, you'd do `wheelSpeed: 0.5`. You could set `wheelSpeed: -1` to invert the delta values and have it call `onUp` instead of `onDown` (and vice versa). *Note: there's also a separate&#x20;*`scrollSpeed`*&#x20;option that only applies to scroll events.*

## Callback data[â€‹](#callback-data "Direct link to Callback data")

Each callback is passed the Observer instance itself as the only parameter so that you can easily access data like `self.velocityX`, `self.velocityY`, `self.deltaX`, `self.deltaY`, `self.x`, `self.y`, etc. (see the sidebar to the left for a list of all the available properties) like:

```
Observer.create({
  ...
  onChange: (self) =>  {
    console.log("velocity:", self.velocityX, self.velocityY, "delta:", self.deltaX, self.deltaY, "target element:", self.target, "last event:", self.event);
  }
});
```

There's a list of properties in the nav bar to the left.

| #### [deltaY](/docs/v3/Plugins/Observer/deltaY.md) : Number                   | The amount of change (in pixels) vertically since the last time a callback was fired on that axis. For example, `onChangeY` or `onDown`                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     |
| #### [event](/docs/v3/Plugins/Observer/event.md) : Event                      | The most recent Event object (could be a TouchEvent, PointerEvent, MouseEvent, WheelEvent, or ScrollEvent based on whatever `type` you define)                                                                                                                                                                                                                              |
| #### [isDragging](/docs/v3/Plugins/Observer/isDragging.md) : Boolean          | When the user presses on the `target` and drags more than the `dragMinimum` (0 by default), `isDragging` is set to `true` until the touch/pointer is released (even if the user continues dragging *outside the bounds of the target*).                                                                                                                                     |
| #### [isEnabled](/docs/v3/Plugins/Observer/isEnabled.md) : Boolean            | Indicates whether or not the Observer is enabled. Use the `enable()` and `disable()` methods to set the state. When an Observer is disabled, it removes all of its event listeners from the target and obviously won't trigger any callbacks. There are `onEnable` and `onDisable` callbacks, though, which of course would be called when you enable/disable the Observer. |
| #### [isPressed](/docs/v3/Plugins/Observer/isPressed.md) : Boolean            | Set to `true` while the user presses on the target (only applies to `type` of "pointer" and "touch")                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        |
| #### [startX](/docs/v3/Plugins/Observer/startX.md) : Number                   | The `clientX` from the most recent `onPress` touch/pointer event, which refers to the horizontal distance from the left edge of the viewport. This only gets updated if you set the `type` to include "touch" and/or "pointer". It's quite useful for dragging logic.                                                                                                       |

This only gets updated if you set the `type` to include "touch" and/or "pointer". It's quite useful for dragging logic.                                                                                                          |
| #### [Observer.isTouch](/docs/v3/Plugins/Observer/static.isTouch.md) : Number | A way to discern the touch capabilities of the current device - `0` is mouse/pointer only (no touch), `1` is touch-only, `2` accommodates both.                                                                                                                                                                                                                             |

| #### [velocityX](/docs/v3/Plugins/Observer/velocityX.md) : Number             | The horizontal velocity (in pixels per second).                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             |

## FAQs[â€‹](#faqs "Direct link to FAQs")

#### Can I apply multiple Observer instances to the same target?

Absolutely! That could be useful if, for example, you want certain callbacks debounced but others not. And remember that you can .disable() and .enable() an Observer anytime.

#### If I'm loading ScrollTrigger already, do I need to ALSO load Observer?

No, Observer is already included inside the ScrollTrigger file; you can access it via [ScrollTrigger.observe()](/docs/v3/Plugins/ScrollTrigger/static.observe\(\).md) and skip loading the Observer file separately.
