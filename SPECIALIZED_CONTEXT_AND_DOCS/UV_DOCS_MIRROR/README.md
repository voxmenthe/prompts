# uv Documentation Mirror

This directory was generated by `create_uv_docs_mirror.py`. It captures:

1. The Markdown sources from the uv repository copied directly into this directory.
2. The rendered documentation extracted from https://docs.astral.sh/uv (`rendered_site/`).

## Layout

- Root: mirror of `uv/docs/` from `/Volumes/cdrive/repos/OTHER_PEOPLES_REPOS/uv`. Skipped directories: .overrides, js, site, stylesheets.
- (HTML snapshots skipped – rerun with `--keep-html` to include them.)
- `rendered_site/markdown/`: simplified Markdown derived from the `<article>` body for quick text search.
- `manifest.json`: metadata about the run.

Total site pages mirrored: **73**.

Run again with:

```bash
uv run python src/DATA_SCRIPTS/create_uv_docs_mirror.py
```

Use `--help` for advanced options (skip components, change paths, etc.).

Each run rebuilds the mirror from scratch and records file deltas in `manifest.json`.
