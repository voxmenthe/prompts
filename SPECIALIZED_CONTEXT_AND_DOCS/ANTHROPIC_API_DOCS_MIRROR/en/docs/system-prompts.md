While these tips apply broadly to all Claude models, you can find prompting tips specific to extended thinking models [here](</docs/en/build-with-claude/prompt-engineering/extended-thinking-tips>).

When using Claude, you can dramatically improve its performance by using the `system` parameter to give it a role. This technique, known as role prompting, is the most powerful way to use system prompts with Claude.

The right role can turn Claude from a general assistant into your virtual domain expert!

**System prompt tips** : Use the `system` parameter to set Claude's role. Put everything else, like task-specific instructions, in the `user` turn instead.

## 

Why use role prompting?

  * **Enhanced accuracy:** In complex scenarios like legal analysis or financial modeling, role prompting can significantly boost Claude's performance.
  * **Tailored tone:** Whether you need a CFO's brevity or a copywriter's flair, role prompting adjusts Claude's communication style.
  * **Improved focus:** By setting the role context, Claude stays more within the bounds of your task's specific requirements.

How to give Claude a role

Use the `system` parameter in the [Messages API](</docs/en/api/messages>) to set Claude's role:

anthropic client = anthropic.Anthropic() response = client.messages.create( model="claude-sonnet-4-5-20250929", max_tokens=2048, system="You are a seasoned data scientist at a Fortune 500 company.", # <\-- role prompt messages=[ {"role": "user", "content": "Analyze this dataset for anomalies: <dataset>{{DATASET}}</dataset>"} ] ) print(response.content)`
[/code]

**Role prompting tip** : Experiment with roles! A `data scientist` might see different insights than a `marketing strategist` for the same data. A `data scientist specializing in customer insight analysis for Fortune 500 companies` might yield different results still!
