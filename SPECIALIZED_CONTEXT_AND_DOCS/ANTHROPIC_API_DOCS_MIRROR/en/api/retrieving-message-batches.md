# Retrieve a Message Batch

get/v1/messages/batches/{message_batch_id}

This endpoint is idempotent and can be used to poll for Message Batch completion. To access the results of a Message Batch, make a request to the `results_url` field in the response.

Learn more about the Message Batches API in our [user guide](<https://docs.claude.com/en/docs/build-with-claude/batch-processing>)

"ended"

request_counts: [MessageBatchRequestCounts](</docs/en/api/messages#message_batch_request_counts>) { canceled, errored, expired, 2 more } 

Tallies requests within the Message Batch, categorized by their status.

Requests start as `processing` and move to one of the other statuses only once processing of the entire batch ends. The sum of all values always matches the total number of requests in the batch.

This is zero until processing of the entire Message Batch has ended.

This is zero until processing of the entire Message Batch has ended.

results_url: string

URL to a `.jsonl` file containing the results of the Message Batch requests. Specified only once processing ends.

Results in the file are not guaranteed to be in the same order as requests. Use the `custom_id` field to match results to requests.
