"ended"

request_counts: [MessageBatchRequestCounts](</docs/en/api/messages#message_batch_request_counts>) { canceled, errored, expired, 2 more }

Requests start as `processing` and move to one of the other statuses only once processing of the entire batch ends. The sum of all values always matches the total number of requests in the batch.

This is zero until processing of the entire Message Batch has ended.

Number of requests in the Message Batch that are processing.

succeeded: number

Number of requests in the Message Batch that have completed successfully.

This is zero until processing of the entire Message Batch has ended.

results_url: string

URL to a `.jsonl` file containing the results of the Message Batch requests. Specified only once processing ends.

Results in the file are not guaranteed to be in the same order as requests. Use the `custom_id` field to match results to requests.

type: "message_batch"

Object type.

For Message Batches, this is always `"message_batch"`.

Accepts one of the following:
