# Glm4

## Overview

The GLM family welcomes new members [GLM-4-0414](https://huggingface.co/papers/2406.12793) series models.

The **GLM-4-32B-0414** series models, featuring 32 billion parameters. Its performance is comparable to OpenAI’s GPT
series and DeepSeek’s V3/R1 series. It also supports very user-friendly local deployment features. GLM-4-32B-Base-0414
was pre-trained on 15T of high-quality data, including substantial reasoning-type synthetic data. This lays the
foundation for subsequent reinforcement learning extensions. In the post-training stage, we employed human preference
alignment for dialogue scenarios. Additionally, using techniques like rejection sampling and reinforcement learning, we
enhanced the model’s performance in instruction following, engineering code, and function calling, thus strengthening
the atomic capabilities required for agent tasks. GLM-4-32B-0414 achieves good results in engineering code, Artifact
generation, function calling, search-based Q&A, and report generation. In particular, on several benchmarks, such as
code generation or specific Q&A tasks, GLM-4-32B-Base-0414 achieves comparable performance with those larger models like
GPT-4o and DeepSeek-V3-0324 (671B).

**GLM-Z1-32B-0414** is a reasoning model with deep thinking capabilities. This was developed based on GLM-4-32B-0414
through cold start, extended reinforcement learning, and further training on tasks including mathematics, code, and
logic. Compared to the base model, GLM-Z1-32B-0414 significantly improves mathematical abilities and the capability to
solve complex tasks. During training, we also introduced general reinforcement learning based on pairwise ranking
feedback, which enhances the model’s general capabilities.

**GLM-Z1-Rumination-32B-0414** is a deep reasoning model with rumination capabilities (against OpenAI’s Deep Research).
Unlike typical deep thinking models, the rumination model is capable of deeper and longer thinking to solve more
open-ended and complex problems (e.g., writing a comparative analysis of AI development in two cities and their future
development plans). Z1-Rumination is trained through scaling end-to-end reinforcement learning with responses graded by
the ground truth answers or rubrics and can make use of search tools during its deep thinking process to handle complex
tasks. The model shows significant improvements in research-style writing and complex tasks.

Finally, **GLM-Z1-9B-0414** is a surprise. We employed all the aforementioned techniques to train a small model (9B).
GLM-Z1-9B-0414 exhibits excellent capabilities in mathematical reasoning and general tasks. Its overall performance is
top-ranked among all open-source models of the same size. Especially in resource-constrained scenarios, this model
achieves an excellent balance between efficiency and effectiveness, providing a powerful option for users seeking
lightweight deployment.

## Glm4Model

### class transformers.Glm4Model

 [< source >](https://github.com/huggingface/transformers/blob/v4.56.2/src/transformers/models/glm4/modeling_glm4.py#L348)

( config: Glm4Config  )

Parameters

* **config** ([Glm4Config](/docs/transformers/v4.56.2/en/model_doc/glm4#transformers.Glm4Config)) —
  Model configuration class with all the parameters of the model. Initializing with a config file does not
  load the weights associated with the model, only the configuration. Check out the
  [from\_pretrained()](/docs/transformers/v4.56.2/en/main_classes/model#transformers.PreTrainedModel.from_pretrained) method to load the model weights.

The bare Glm4 Model outputting raw hidden-states without any specific head on top.

This model inherits from [PreTrainedModel](/docs/transformers/v4.56.2/en/main_classes/model#transformers.PreTrainedModel). Check the superclass documentation for the generic methods the
library implements for all its model (such as downloading or saving, resizing the input embeddings, pruning heads
etc.)

This model is also a PyTorch [torch.nn.Module](https://pytorch.org/docs/stable/nn.html#torch.nn.Module) subclass.
Use it as a regular PyTorch Module and refer to the PyTorch documentation for all matter related to general usage
and behavior.

#### forward

( input\_ids: typing.Optional[torch.LongTensor] = None attention\_mask: typing.Optional[torch.Tensor] = None position\_ids: typing.Optional[torch.LongTensor] = None past\_key\_values: typing.Optional[transformers.cache\_utils.Cache] = None inputs\_embeds: typing.Optional[torch.FloatTensor] = None cache\_position: typing.Optional[torch.LongTensor] = None use\_cache: typing.Optional[bool] = None \*\*kwargs: typing\_extensions.Unpack[transformers.utils.generic.TransformersKwargs]  ) → [transformers.modeling\_outputs.BaseModelOutputWithPast](/docs/transformers/v4.56.2/en/main_classes/output#transformers.modeling_outputs.BaseModelOutputWithPast) or `tuple(torch.FloatTensor)`

Parameters

* **input\_ids** (`torch.LongTensor` of shape `(batch_size, sequence_length)`, *optional*) —
  Indices of input sequence tokens in the vocabulary. Padding will be ignored by default.

  Indices can be obtained using [AutoTokenizer](/docs/transformers/v4.56.2/en/model_doc/auto#transformers.AutoTokenizer). See [PreTrainedTokenizer.encode()](/docs/transformers/v4.56.2/en/internal/tokenization_utils#transformers.PreTrainedTokenizerBase.encode) and
  [PreTrainedTokenizer.**call**()](/docs/transformers/v4.56.2/en/internal/tokenization_utils#transformers.PreTrainedTokenizerBase.__call__) for details.

  [What are input IDs?](../glossary#input-ids)
* **attention\_mask** (`torch.Tensor` of shape `(batch_size, sequence_length)`, *optional*) —
  Mask to avoid performing attention on padding token indices. Mask values selected in `[0, 1]`:
  + 1 for tokens that are **not masked**,
  + 0 for tokens that are **masked**.

  [What are attention masks?](../glossary#attention-mask)
* **position\_ids** (`torch.LongTensor` of shape `(batch_size, sequence_length)`, *optional*) —
  Indices of positions of each input sequence tokens in the position embeddings. Selected in the range `[0, config.n_positions - 1]`.

  [What are position IDs?](../glossary#position-ids)
* **past\_key\_values** (`~cache_utils.Cache`, *optional*) —
  Pre-computed hidden-states (key and values in the self-attention blocks and in the cross-attention
  blocks) that can be used to speed up sequential decoding. This typically consists in the `past_key_values`
  returned by the model at a previous stage of decoding, when `use_cache=True` or `config.use_cache=True`.

  Only [Cache](/docs/transformers/v4.56.2/en/internal/generation_utils#transformers.Cache) instance is allowed as input, see our [kv cache guide](https://huggingface.co/docs/transformers/en/kv_cache).
  If no `past_key_values` are passed, [DynamicCache](/docs/transformers/v4.56.2/en/internal/generation_utils#transformers.DynamicCache) will be initialized by default.

  The model will output the same cache format that is fed as input.

  If `past_key_values` are used, the user is expected to input only unprocessed `input_ids` (those that don’t
  have their past key value states given to this model) of shape `(batch_size, unprocessed_length)` instead of all `input_ids`
  of shape `(batch_size, sequence_length)`.
* **inputs\_embeds** (`torch.FloatTensor` of shape `(batch_size, sequence_length, hidden_size)`, *optional*) —
  Optionally, instead of passing `input_ids` you can choose to directly pass an embedded representation. This
  is useful if you want more control over how to convert `input_ids` indices into associated vectors than the
  model’s internal embedding lookup matrix.
* **cache\_position** (`torch.LongTensor` of shape `(sequence_length)`, *optional*) —
  Indices depicting the position of the input sequence tokens in the sequence. Contrarily to `position_ids`,
  this tensor is not affected by padding. It is used to update the cache in the correct position and to infer
  the complete sequence length.
* **use\_cache** (`bool`, *optional*) —
  If set to `True`, `past_key_values` key value states are returned and can be used to speed up decoding (see
  `past_key_values`).

Returns

[transformers.modeling\_outputs.BaseModelOutputWithPast](/docs/transformers/v4.56.2/en/main_classes/output#transformers.modeling_outputs.BaseModelOutputWithPast) or `tuple(torch.FloatTensor)`

A [transformers.modeling\_outputs.BaseModelOutputWithPast](/docs/transformers/v4.56.2/en/main_classes/output#transformers.modeling_outputs.BaseModelOutputWithPast) or a tuple of
`torch.FloatTensor` (if `return_dict=False` is passed or when `config.return_dict=False`) comprising various
elements depending on the configuration ([Glm4Config](/docs/transformers/v4.56.2/en/model_doc/glm4#transformers.Glm4Config)) and inputs.

* **last\_hidden\_state** (`torch.FloatTensor` of shape `(batch_size, sequence_length, hidden_size)`) — Sequence of hidden-states at the output of the last layer of the model.

  If `past_key_values` is used only the last hidden-state of the sequences of shape `(batch_size, 1, hidden_size)` is output.
* **past\_key\_values** (`Cache`, *optional*, returned when `use_cache=True` is passed or when `config.use_cache=True`) — It is a [Cache](/docs/transformers/v4.56.2/en/internal/generation_utils#transformers.Cache) instance. For more details, see our [kv cache guide](https://huggingface.co/docs/transformers/en/kv_cache).

  Contains pre-computed hidden-states (key and values in the self-attention blocks and optionally if
  `config.is_encoder_decoder=True` in the cross-attention blocks) that can be used (see `past_key_values`
  input) to speed up sequential decoding.
* **hidden\_states** (`tuple(torch.FloatTensor)`, *optional*, returned when `output_hidden_states=True` is passed or when `config.output_hidden_states=True`) — Tuple of `torch.FloatTensor` (one for the output of the embeddings, if the model has an embedding layer, +
  one for the output of each layer) of shape `(batch_size, sequence_length, hidden_size)`.

  Hidden-states of the model at the output of each layer plus the optional initial embedding outputs.
* **attentions** (`tuple(torch.FloatTensor)`, *optional*, returned when `output_attentions=True` is passed or when `config.output_attentions=True`) — Tuple of `torch.FloatTensor` (one for each layer) of shape `(batch_size, num_heads, sequence_length, sequence_length)`.

  Attentions weights after the attention softmax, used to compute the weighted average in the self-attention
  heads.

The [Glm4Model](/docs/transformers/v4.56.2/en/model_doc/glm4#transformers.Glm4Model) forward method, overrides the `__call__` special method.

Although the recipe for forward pass needs to be defined within this function, one should call the `Module`
instance afterwards instead of this since the former takes care of running the pre and post processing steps while
the latter silently ignores them.

Parameters

* **input\_ids** (`torch.LongTensor` of shape `(batch_size, sequence_length)`, *optional*) —
  Indices of input sequence tokens in the vocabulary. Padding will be ignored by default.

  Indices can be obtained using [AutoTokenizer](/docs/transformers/v4.56.2/en/model_doc/auto#transformers.AutoTokenizer). See [PreTrainedTokenizer.encode()](/docs/transformers/v4.56.2/en/internal/tokenization_utils#transformers.PreTrainedTokenizerBase.encode) and

  [What are attention masks?](../glossary#attention-mask)

  [What are position IDs?](../glossary#position-ids)
* **past\_key\_values** (`~cache_utils.Cache`, *optional*) —
  Pre-computed hidden-states (key and values in the self-attention blocks and in the cross-attention
  blocks) that can be used to speed up sequential decoding. This typically consists in the `past_key_values`
  returned by the model at a previous stage of decoding, when `use_cache=True` or `config.use_cache=True`.

  Only [Cache](/docs/transformers/v4.56.2/en/internal/generation_utils#transformers.Cache) instance is allowed as input, see our [kv cache guide](https://huggingface.co/docs/transformers/en/kv_cache).
  If no `past_key_values` are passed, [DynamicCache](/docs/transformers/v4.56.2/en/internal/generation_utils#transformers.DynamicCache) will be initialized by default.

  The model will output the same cache format that is fed as input.

  If `past_key_values` are used, the user is expected to input only unprocessed `input_ids` (those that don’t
  have their past key value states given to this model) of shape `(batch_size, unprocessed_length)` instead of all `input_ids`
  of shape `(batch_size, sequence_length)`.
* **inputs\_embeds** (`torch.FloatTensor` of shape `(batch_size, sequence_length, hidden_size)`, *optional*) —
  Optionally, instead of passing `input_ids` you can choose to directly pass an embedded representation. This
  is useful if you want more control over how to convert `input_ids` indices into associated vectors than the
  model’s internal embedding lookup matrix.
* **labels** (`torch.LongTensor` of shape `(batch_size, sequence_length)`, *optional*) —
  Labels for computing the masked language modeling loss. Indices should either be in `[0, ..., config.vocab_size]` or -100 (see `input_ids` docstring). Tokens with indices set to `-100` are ignored
  (masked), the loss is only computed for the tokens with labels in `[0, ..., config.vocab_size]`.
* **use\_cache** (`bool`, *optional*) —
  If set to `True`, `past_key_values` key value states are returned and can be used to speed up decoding (see
  `past_key_values`).
* **cache\_position** (`torch.LongTensor` of shape `(sequence_length)`, *optional*) —
  Indices depicting the position of the input sequence tokens in the sequence. Contrarily to `position_ids`,
  this tensor is not affected by padding. It is used to update the cache in the correct position and to infer
  the complete sequence length.
* **logits\_to\_keep** (`Union[int, torch.Tensor]`, defaults to `0`) —
  If an `int`, compute logits for the last `logits_to_keep` tokens. If `0`, calculate logits for all
  `input_ids` (special case). Only last token logits are needed for generation, and calculating them only for that
  token can save memory, which becomes pretty significant for long sequences or large vocabulary size.
  If a `torch.Tensor`, must be 1D corresponding to the indices to keep in the sequence length dimension.
  This is useful when using packed tensor format (single dimension for batch and sequence length).

  Indices of positions of each input sequence tokens in the position embeddings. Selected in the range `[0, config.n_positions - 1]`.

  [What are position IDs?](../glossary#position-ids)
* **past\_key\_values** (`~cache_utils.Cache`, *optional*) —
  Pre-computed hidden-states (key and values in the self-attention blocks and in the cross-attention
  blocks) that can be used to speed up sequential decoding. This typically consists in the `past_key_values`
  returned by the model at a previous stage of decoding, when `use_cache=True` or `config.use_cache=True`.

  Only [Cache](/docs/transformers/v4.56.2/en/internal/generation_utils#transformers.Cache) instance is allowed as input, see our [kv cache guide](https://huggingface.co/docs/transformers/en/kv_cache).
  If no `past_key_values` are passed, [DynamicCache](/docs/transformers/v4.56.2/en/internal/generation_utils#transformers.DynamicCache) will be initialized by default.

  The model will output the same cache format that is fed as input.

  If `past_key_values` are used, the user is expected to input only unprocessed `input_ids` (those that don’t
  have their past key value states given to this model) of shape `(batch_size, unprocessed_length)` instead of all `input_ids`
  of shape `(batch_size, sequence_length)`.
* **inputs\_embeds** (`torch.FloatTensor` of shape `(batch_size, sequence_length, hidden_size)`, *optional*) —
  Optionally, instead of passing `input_ids` you can choose to directly pass an embedded representation. This
  is useful if you want more control over how to convert `input_ids` indices into associated vectors than the
  model’s internal embedding lookup matrix.
* **labels** (`torch.LongTensor` of shape `(batch_size, sequence_length)`, *optional*) —
  Labels for computing the masked language modeling loss. Indices should either be in `[0, ..., config.vocab_size]` or -100 (see `input_ids` docstring). Tokens with indices set to `-100` are ignored
  (masked), the loss is only computed for the tokens with labels in `[0, ..., config.vocab_size]`.
* **use\_cache** (`bool`, *optional*) —
  If set to `True`, `past_key_values` key value states are returned and can be used to speed up decoding (see
  `past_key_values`).

Returns

`transformers.modeling_outputs.SequenceClassifierOutputWithPast` or `tuple(torch.FloatTensor)`

A `transformers.modeling_outputs.SequenceClassifierOutputWithPast` or a tuple of
`torch.FloatTensor` (if `return_dict=False` is passed or when `config.return_dict=False`) comprising various
elements depending on the configuration (`None`) and inputs.

* **loss** (`torch.FloatTensor` of shape `(1,)`, *optional*, returned when `labels` is provided) — Classification (or regression if config.num\_labels==1) loss.
* **logits** (`torch.FloatTensor` of shape `(batch_size, config.num_labels)`) — Classification (or regression if config.num\_labels==1) scores (before SoftMax).
* **past\_key\_values** (`Cache`, *optional*, returned when `use_cache=True` is passed or when `config.use_cache=True`) — It is a [Cache](/docs/transformers/v4.56.2/en/internal/generation_utils#transformers.Cache) instance. For more details, see our [kv cache guide](https://huggingface.co/docs/transformers/en/kv_cache).

  Contains pre-computed hidden-states (key and values in the self-attention blocks) that can be used (see
  `past_key_values` input) to speed up sequential decoding.
* **hidden\_states** (`tuple(torch.FloatTensor)`, *optional*, returned when `output_hidden_states=True` is passed or when `config.output_hidden_states=True`) — Tuple of `torch.FloatTensor` (one for the output of the embeddings, if the model has an embedding layer, +
  one for the output of each layer) of shape `(batch_size, sequence_length, hidden_size)`.

  Hidden-states of the model at the output of each layer plus the optional initial embedding outputs.
* **attentions** (`tuple(torch.FloatTensor)`, *optional*, returned when `output_attentions=True` is passed or when `config.output_attentions=True`) — Tuple of `torch.FloatTensor` (one for each layer) of shape `(batch_size, num_heads, sequence_length, sequence_length)`.

  Attentions weights after the attention softmax, used to compute the weighted average in the self-attention
  heads.

The `GenericForSequenceClassification` forward method, overrides the `__call__` special method.

Although the recipe for forward pass needs to be defined within this function, one should call the `Module`
instance afterwards instead of this since the former takes care of running the pre and post processing steps while
the latter silently ignores them.
