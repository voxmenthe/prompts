# Splinter

![PyTorch](https://img.shields.io/badge/PyTorch-DE3412?style=flat&logo=pytorch&logoColor=white)

## Overview

The Splinter model was proposed in [Few-Shot Question Answering by Pretraining Span Selection](https://huggingface.co/papers/2101.00438) by Ori Ram, Yuval Kirstain, Jonathan Berant, Amir Globerson, Omer Levy. Splinter
is an encoder-only transformer (similar to BERT) pretrained using the recurring span selection task on a large corpus
comprising Wikipedia and the Toronto Book Corpus.

The abstract from the paper is the following:

In several question answering benchmarks, pretrained models have reached human parity through fine-tuning on an order
of 100,000 annotated questions and answers. We explore the more realistic few-shot setting, where only a few hundred
training examples are available, and observe that standard models perform poorly, highlighting the discrepancy between
current pretraining objectives and question answering. We propose a new pretraining scheme tailored for question
answering: recurring span selection. Given a passage with multiple sets of recurring spans, we mask in each set all
recurring spans but one, and ask the model to select the correct span in the passage for each masked span. Masked spans
are replaced with a special token, viewed as a question representation, that is later used during fine-tuning to select
the answer span. The resulting model obtains surprisingly good results on multiple benchmarks (e.g., 72.7 F1 on SQuAD
with only 128 training examples), while maintaining competitive performance in the high-resource setting.

This model was contributed by [yuvalkirstain](https://huggingface.co/yuvalkirstain) and [oriram](https://huggingface.co/oriram). The original code can be found [here](https://github.com/oriram/splinter).

## Usage tips

* Splinter was trained to predict answers spans conditioned on a special [QUESTION] token. These tokens contextualize
  to question representations which are used to predict the answers. This layer is called QASS, and is the default
  behaviour in the [SplinterForQuestionAnswering](/docs/transformers/v4.56.2/en/model_doc/splinter#transformers.SplinterForQuestionAnswering) class. Therefore:
* Use [SplinterTokenizer](/docs/transformers/v4.56.2/en/model_doc/splinter#transformers.SplinterTokenizer) (rather than [BertTokenizer](/docs/transformers/v4.56.2/en/model_doc/bert#transformers.BertTokenizer)), as it already
  contains this special token. Also, its default behavior is to use this token when two sequences are given (for
  example, in the *run\_qa.py* script).
* If you plan on using Splinter outside *run\_qa.py*, please keep in mind the question token - it might be important for
  the success of your model, especially in a few-shot setting.
* Please note there are two different checkpoints for each size of Splinter. Both are basically the same, except that
  one also has the pretrained weights of the QASS layer (*tau/splinter-base-qass* and *tau/splinter-large-qass*) and one
  doesn’t (*tau/splinter-base* and *tau/splinter-large*). This is done to support randomly initializing this layer at
  fine-tuning, as it is shown to yield better results for some cases in the paper.

This is the configuration class to store the configuration of a [SplinterModel](/docs/transformers/v4.56.2/en/model_doc/splinter#transformers.SplinterModel). It is used to instantiate an
Splinter model according to the specified arguments, defining the model architecture. Instantiating a configuration
with the defaults will yield a similar configuration to that of the Splinter
[tau/splinter-base](https://huggingface.co/tau/splinter-base) architecture.

Configuration objects inherit from [PretrainedConfig](/docs/transformers/v4.56.2/en/main_classes/configuration#transformers.PretrainedConfig) and can be used to control the model outputs. Read the
documentation from [PretrainedConfig](/docs/transformers/v4.56.2/en/main_classes/configuration#transformers.PretrainedConfig) for more information.

Example:


```
>>> from transformers import SplinterModel, SplinterConfig

>>> # Initializing a Splinter tau/splinter-base style configuration
>>> configuration = SplinterConfig()

>>> # Initializing a model from the tau/splinter-base style configuration
>>> model = SplinterModel(configuration)

>>> # Accessing the model configuration
>>> configuration = model.config
```

  one for the output of each layer) of shape `(batch_size, sequence_length, hidden_size)`.

  Hidden-states of the model at the output of each layer plus the optional initial embedding outputs.
* **attentions** (`tuple(torch.FloatTensor)`, *optional*, returned when `output_attentions=True` is passed or when `config.output_attentions=True`) — Tuple of `torch.FloatTensor` (one for each layer) of shape `(batch_size, num_heads, sequence_length, sequence_length)`.

  heads.

The [SplinterModel](/docs/transformers/v4.56.2/en/model_doc/splinter#transformers.SplinterModel) forward method, overrides the `__call__` special method.

Although the recipe for forward pass needs to be defined within this function, one should call the `Module`
instance afterwards instead of this since the former takes care of running the pre and post processing steps while
the latter silently ignores them.

* **head\_mask** (`torch.Tensor` of shape `(num_heads,)` or `(num_layers, num_heads)`, *optional*) —
  Mask to nullify selected heads of the self-attention modules. Mask values selected in `[0, 1]`:
  + 1 indicates the head is **not masked**,
  + 0 indicates the head is **masked**.
* **inputs\_embeds** (`torch.Tensor` of shape `(batch_size, sequence_length, hidden_size)`, *optional*) —
  Optionally, instead of passing `input_ids` you can choose to directly pass an embedded representation. This
  is useful if you want more control over how to convert `input_ids` indices into associated vectors than the
  model’s internal embedding lookup matrix.
* **start\_positions** (`torch.LongTensor` of shape `(batch_size,)`, *optional*) —
  Labels for position (index) of the start of the labelled span for computing the token classification loss.
  Positions are clamped to the length of the sequence (`sequence_length`). Position outside of the sequence
  are not taken into account for computing the loss.
* **end\_positions** (`torch.LongTensor` of shape `(batch_size,)`, *optional*) —
  Labels for position (index) of the end of the labelled span for computing the token classification loss.
  Positions are clamped to the length of the sequence (`sequence_length`). Position outside of the sequence
  are not taken into account for computing the loss.

  Whether or not to return the attentions tensors of all attention layers. See `attentions` under returned
  tensors for more detail.
* **output\_hidden\_states** (`bool`, *optional*) —
  Whether or not to return the hidden states of all layers. See `hidden_states` under returned tensors for
  more detail.
* **return\_dict** (`bool`, *optional*) —
  Whether or not to return a [ModelOutput](/docs/transformers/v4.56.2/en/main_classes/output#transformers.utils.ModelOutput) instead of a plain tuple.
* **question\_positions** (`torch.LongTensor` of shape `(batch_size, num_questions)`, *optional*) —
  The positions of all question tokens. If given, start\_logits and end\_logits will be of shape `(batch_size, num_questions, sequence_length)`. If None, the first question token in each sequence in the batch will be
  the only one for which start\_logits and end\_logits are calculated and they will be of shape `(batch_size, sequence_length)`.

Returns

[transformers.modeling\_outputs.QuestionAnsweringModelOutput](/docs/transformers/v4.56.2/en/main_classes/output#transformers.modeling_outputs.QuestionAnsweringModelOutput) or `tuple(torch.FloatTensor)`

A [transformers.modeling\_outputs.QuestionAnsweringModelOutput](/docs/transformers/v4.56.2/en/main_classes/output#transformers.modeling_outputs.QuestionAnsweringModelOutput) or a tuple of
`torch.FloatTensor` (if `return_dict=False` is passed or when `config.return_dict=False`) comprising various
elements depending on the configuration ([SplinterConfig](/docs/transformers/v4.56.2/en/model_doc/splinter#transformers.SplinterConfig)) and inputs.

* **loss** (`torch.FloatTensor` of shape `(1,)`, *optional*, returned when `labels` is provided) — Total span extraction loss is the sum of a Cross-Entropy for the start and end positions.

  one for the output of each layer) of shape `(batch_size, sequence_length, hidden_size)`.

  Hidden-states of the model at the output of each layer plus the optional initial embedding outputs.
* **attentions** (`tuple(torch.FloatTensor)`, *optional*, returned when `output_attentions=True` is passed or when `config.output_attentions=True`) — Tuple of `torch.FloatTensor` (one for each layer) of shape `(batch_size, num_heads, sequence_length, sequence_length)`.

  Attentions weights after the attention softmax, used to compute the weighted average in the self-attention
  heads.

The [SplinterForQuestionAnswering](/docs/transformers/v4.56.2/en/model_doc/splinter#transformers.SplinterForQuestionAnswering) forward method, overrides the `__call__` special method.

Although the recipe for forward pass needs to be defined within this function, one should call the `Module`
instance afterwards instead of this since the former takes care of running the pre and post processing steps while
the latter silently ignores them.

Example:


```
>>> from transformers import AutoTokenizer, SplinterForQuestionAnswering
>>> import torch

>>> tokenizer = AutoTokenizer.from_pretrained("tau/splinter-base")
>>> model = SplinterForQuestionAnswering.from_pretrained("tau/splinter-base")

>>> question, text = "Who was Jim Henson?", "Jim Henson was a nice puppet"

>>> inputs = tokenizer(question, text, return_tensors="pt")
>>> with torch.no_grad():
...     outputs = model(**inputs)

>>> answer_start_index = outputs.start_logits.argmax()
>>> answer_end_index = outputs.end_logits.argmax()

>>> predict_answer_tokens = inputs.input_ids[0, answer_start_index : answer_end_index + 1]
>>> tokenizer.decode(predict_answer_tokens, skip_special_tokens=True)
...

>>> # target is "nice puppet"
>>> target_start_index = torch.tensor([14])
>>> target_end_index = torch.tensor([15])

>>> outputs = model(**inputs, start_positions=target_start_index, end_positions=target_end_index)
>>> loss = outputs.loss
>>> round(loss.item(), 2)
...

( config  )

Parameters

* **config** ([SplinterForPreTraining](/docs/transformers/v4.56.2/en/model_doc/splinter#transformers.SplinterForPreTraining)) —
  Model configuration class with all the parameters of the model. Initializing with a config file does not
  load the weights associated with the model, only the configuration. Check out the
  [from\_pretrained()](/docs/transformers/v4.56.2/en/main_classes/model#transformers.PreTrainedModel.from_pretrained) method to load the model weights.

Splinter Model for the recurring span selection task as done during the pretraining. The difference to the QA task
is that we do not have a question, but multiple question tokens that replace the occurrences of recurring spans
instead.

This model inherits from [PreTrainedModel](/docs/transformers/v4.56.2/en/main_classes/model#transformers.PreTrainedModel). Check the superclass documentation for the generic methods the
library implements for all its model (such as downloading or saving, resizing the input embeddings, pruning heads
etc.)

This model is also a PyTorch [torch.nn.Module](https://pytorch.org/docs/stable/nn.html#torch.nn.Module) subclass.
Use it as a regular PyTorch Module and refer to the PyTorch documentation for all matter related to general usage
and behavior.
