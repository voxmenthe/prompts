# BigBirdPegasus

[BigBirdPegasus](https://huggingface.co/papers/2007.14062) is an encoder-decoder (sequence-to-sequence) transformer model for long-input summarization. It extends the [BigBird](./big_bird) architecture with an additional pretraining objective borrowed from [Pegasus](./pegasus) called gap sequence generation (GSG). Whole sentences are masked and the model has to fill in the gaps in the document. BigBirdPegasus’s ability to keep track of long contexts makes it effective at summarizing lengthy inputs, surpassing the performance of base Pegasus models.

You can find all the original BigBirdPegasus checkpoints under the [Google](https://huggingface.co/google/models?search=bigbird-pegasus) organization.

This model was contributed by [vasudevgupta](https://huggingface.co/vasudevgupta).

Click on the BigBirdPegasus models in the right sidebar for more examples of how to apply BigBirdPegasus to different language tasks.

The example below demonstrates how to summarize text with [Pipeline](/docs/transformers/v4.56.2/en/main_classes/pipelines#transformers.Pipeline), [AutoModel](/docs/transformers/v4.56.2/en/model_doc/auto#transformers.AutoModel), and from the command line.

In the presence of light, plants absorb carbon dioxide from the atmosphere through small pores in their leaves called stomata, and take in water from the soil through their root systems.
These ingredients are then transformed into glucose, a type of sugar that serves as a source of chemical energy, and oxygen, which is released as a byproduct into the atmosphere. The glucose produced during photosynthesis is not just used immediately; plants also store it as starch or convert it into other organic compounds like cellulose, which is essential for building their cellular structure.

Quantization reduces the memory burden of large models by representing the weights in a lower precision. Refer to the [Quantization](../quantization/overview) overview for more available quantization backends.

The example below uses [bitsandbytes](../quantization/bitsandbytes) to only quantize the weights to int4.

## Notes

* BigBirdPegasus also uses the [PegasusTokenizer](/docs/transformers/v4.56.2/en/model_doc/pegasus#transformers.PegasusTokenizer).
* Inputs should be padded on the right because BigBird uses absolute position embeddings.
* BigBirdPegasus supports `original_full` and `block_sparse` attention. If the input sequence length is less than 1024, it is recommended to use `original_full` since sparse patterns don’t offer much benefit for smaller inputs.
* The current implementation uses window size of 3 blocks and 2 global blocks, only supports the ITC-implementation, and doesn’t support `num_random_blocks=0`.
* The sequence length must be divisible by the block size.

This is the configuration class to store the configuration of a [BigBirdPegasusModel](/docs/transformers/v4.56.2/en/model_doc/bigbird_pegasus#transformers.BigBirdPegasusModel). It is used to instantiate
an BigBirdPegasus model according to the specified arguments, defining the model architecture. Instantiating a
configuration with the defaults will yield a similar configuration to that of the BigBirdPegasus
[google/bigbird-pegasus-large-arxiv](https://huggingface.co/google/bigbird-pegasus-large-arxiv) architecture.

Configuration objects inherit from [PretrainedConfig](/docs/transformers/v4.56.2/en/main_classes/configuration#transformers.PretrainedConfig) and can be used to control the model outputs. Read the
documentation from [PretrainedConfig](/docs/transformers/v4.56.2/en/main_classes/configuration#transformers.PretrainedConfig) for more information.

Example:


```
>>> from transformers import BigBirdPegasusConfig, BigBirdPegasusModel

>>> # Initializing a BigBirdPegasus bigbird-pegasus-base style configuration
>>> configuration = BigBirdPegasusConfig()

>>> # Initializing a model (with random weights) from the bigbird-pegasus-base style configuration
>>> model = BigBirdPegasusModel(configuration)

Parameters

* **input\_ids** (`torch.LongTensor` of shape `(batch_size, sequence_length)`, *optional*) —
  Indices of input sequence tokens in the vocabulary. Padding will be ignored by default.

  Indices can be obtained using [AutoTokenizer](/docs/transformers/v4.56.2/en/model_doc/auto#transformers.AutoTokenizer). See [PreTrainedTokenizer.encode()](/docs/transformers/v4.56.2/en/internal/tokenization_utils#transformers.PreTrainedTokenizerBase.encode) and
  [PreTrainedTokenizer.**call**()](/docs/transformers/v4.56.2/en/internal/tokenization_utils#transformers.PreTrainedTokenizerBase.__call__) for details.

  [What are input IDs?](../glossary#input-ids)
* **attention\_mask** (`torch.Tensor` of shape `(batch_size, sequence_length)`, *optional*) —
  Mask to avoid performing attention on padding token indices. Mask values selected in `[0, 1]`:
  + 1 for tokens that are **not masked**,
  + 0 for tokens that are **masked**.

  [What are attention masks?](../glossary#attention-mask)
* **decoder\_input\_ids** (`torch.LongTensor` of shape `(batch_size, target_sequence_length)`, *optional*) —
  Provide for translation and summarization training. By default, the model will create this tensor by
  shifting the `input_ids` to the right, following the paper.
* **decoder\_attention\_mask** (`torch.LongTensor` of shape `(batch_size, target_sequence_length)`, *optional*) —
  Default behavior: generate a tensor that ignores pad tokens in `decoder_input_ids`. Causal mask will also
  be used by default.

  If you want to change padding behavior, you should read
  `modeling_bigbird_pegasus._prepare_decoder_attention_mask` and modify to your needs. See diagram 1 in
  [the paper](https://huggingface.co/papers/1910.13461) for more information on the default strategy.
* **head\_mask** (`torch.Tensor` of shape `(num_heads,)` or `(num_layers, num_heads)`, *optional*) —
  Mask to nullify selected heads of the self-attention modules. Mask values selected in `[0, 1]`:
  + 1 indicates the head is **not masked**,
  + 0 indicates the head is **masked**.
* **decoder\_head\_mask** (`torch.Tensor` of shape `(num_layers, num_heads)`, *optional*) —
  Mask to nullify selected heads of the attention modules in the decoder. Mask values selected in `[0, 1]`:
  + 1 indicates the head is **not masked**,
  + 0 indicates the head is **masked**.
* **cross\_attn\_head\_mask** (`torch.Tensor` of shape `(num_layers, num_heads)`, *optional*) —
  Mask to nullify selected heads of the cross-attention modules. Mask values selected in `[0, 1]`:
  + 1 indicates the head is **not masked**,
  + 0 indicates the head is **masked**.
* **encoder\_outputs** (`list[torch.FloatTensor]`, *optional*) —
  Tuple consists of (`last_hidden_state`, *optional*: `hidden_states`, *optional*: `attentions`)
  `last_hidden_state` of shape `(batch_size, sequence_length, hidden_size)`, *optional*) is a sequence of
  hidden-states at the output of the last layer of the encoder. Used in the cross-attention of the decoder.
* **past\_key\_values** (`~cache_utils.Cache`, *optional*) —
  Pre-computed hidden-states (key and values in the self-attention blocks and in the cross-attention
  blocks) that can be used to speed up sequential decoding. This typically consists in the `past_key_values`
  returned by the model at a previous stage of decoding, when `use_cache=True` or `config.use_cache=True`.

  Only [Cache](/docs/transformers/v4.56.2/en/internal/generation_utils#transformers.Cache) instance is allowed as input, see our [kv cache guide](https://huggingface.co/docs/transformers/en/kv_cache).
  If no `past_key_values` are passed, [DynamicCache](/docs/transformers/v4.56.2/en/internal/generation_utils#transformers.DynamicCache) will be initialized by default.

  The model will output the same cache format that is fed as input.

  If `past_key_values` are used, the user is expected to input only unprocessed `input_ids` (those that don’t
  have their past key value states given to this model) of shape `(batch_size, unprocessed_length)` instead of all `input_ids`
  of shape `(batch_size, sequence_length)`.
* **inputs\_embeds** (`torch.FloatTensor` of shape `(batch_size, sequence_length, hidden_size)`, *optional*) —
  Optionally, instead of passing `input_ids` you can choose to directly pass an embedded representation. This
  is useful if you want more control over how to convert `input_ids` indices into associated vectors than the
  model’s internal embedding lookup matrix.
* **decoder\_inputs\_embeds** (`torch.FloatTensor` of shape `(batch_size, target_sequence_length, hidden_size)`, *optional*) —
  Optionally, instead of passing `decoder_input_ids` you can choose to directly pass an embedded
  representation. If `past_key_values` is used, optionally only the last `decoder_inputs_embeds` have to be
  input (see `past_key_values`). This is useful if you want more control over how to convert
  `decoder_input_ids` indices into associated vectors than the model’s internal embedding lookup matrix.

  If `decoder_input_ids` and `decoder_inputs_embeds` are both unset, `decoder_inputs_embeds` takes the value
  of `inputs_embeds`.
* **use\_cache** (`bool`, *optional*) —
  If set to `True`, `past_key_values` key value states are returned and can be used to speed up decoding (see
  `past_key_values`).
* **output\_attentions** (`bool`, *optional*) —
  Whether or not to return the attentions tensors of all attention layers. See `attentions` under returned
  tensors for more detail.
* **output\_hidden\_states** (`bool`, *optional*) —
  Whether or not to return the hidden states of all layers. See `hidden_states` under returned tensors for
  more detail.
* **return\_dict** (`bool`, *optional*) —
  Whether or not to return a [ModelOutput](/docs/transformers/v4.56.2/en/main_classes/output#transformers.utils.ModelOutput) instead of a plain tuple.
* **cache\_position** (`torch.LongTensor` of shape `(sequence_length)`, *optional*) —
  Indices depicting the position of the input sequence tokens in the sequence. Contrarily to `position_ids`,
  this tensor is not affected by padding. It is used to update the cache in the correct position and to infer
  the complete sequence length.

The [BigBirdPegasusModel](/docs/transformers/v4.56.2/en/model_doc/bigbird_pegasus#transformers.BigBirdPegasusModel) forward method, overrides the `__call__` special method.

Although the recipe for forward pass needs to be defined within this function, one should call the `Module`
instance afterwards instead of this since the former takes care of running the pre and post processing steps while
the latter silently ignores them.

* **decoder\_attention\_mask** (`torch.LongTensor` of shape `(batch_size, target_sequence_length)`, *optional*) —
  Default behavior: generate a tensor that ignores pad tokens in `decoder_input_ids`. Causal mask will also
  be used by default.

  If you want to change padding behavior, you should read
  `modeling_bigbird_pegasus._prepare_decoder_attention_mask` and modify to your needs. See diagram 1 in
  [the paper](https://huggingface.co/papers/1910.13461) for more information on the default strategy.
* **head\_mask** (`torch.Tensor` of shape `(num_heads,)` or `(num_layers, num_heads)`, *optional*) —
  Mask to nullify selected heads of the self-attention modules. Mask values selected in `[0, 1]`:
  + 1 indicates the head is **not masked**,
  + 0 indicates the head is **masked**.
* **decoder\_head\_mask** (`torch.Tensor` of shape `(num_layers, num_heads)`, *optional*) —
  Mask to nullify selected heads of the attention modules in the decoder. Mask values selected in `[0, 1]`:
  + 1 indicates the head is **not masked**,
  + 0 indicates the head is **masked**.
* **cross\_attn\_head\_mask** (`torch.Tensor` of shape `(num_layers, num_heads)`, *optional*) —
  Mask to nullify selected heads of the cross-attention modules. Mask values selected in `[0, 1]`:
  + 1 indicates the head is **not masked**,
  + 0 indicates the head is **masked**.
* **encoder\_outputs** (`list[torch.FloatTensor]`, *optional*) —
  Tuple consists of (`last_hidden_state`, *optional*: `hidden_states`, *optional*: `attentions`)
  `last_hidden_state` of shape `(batch_size, sequence_length, hidden_size)`, *optional*) is a sequence of
  hidden-states at the output of the last layer of the encoder. Used in the cross-attention of the decoder.
* **past\_key\_values** (`~cache_utils.Cache`, *optional*) —
  Pre-computed hidden-states (key and values in the self-attention blocks and in the cross-attention
  blocks) that can be used to speed up sequential decoding. This typically consists in the `past_key_values`
  returned by the model at a previous stage of decoding, when `use_cache=True` or `config.use_cache=True`.

  Only [Cache](/docs/transformers/v4.56.2/en/internal/generation_utils#transformers.Cache) instance is allowed as input, see our [kv cache guide](https://huggingface.co/docs/transformers/en/kv_cache).
  If no `past_key_values` are passed, [DynamicCache](/docs/transformers/v4.56.2/en/internal/generation_utils#transformers.DynamicCache) will be initialized by default.

  The model will output the same cache format that is fed as input.

  If `past_key_values` are used, the user is expected to input only unprocessed `input_ids` (those that don’t
  have their past key value states given to this model) of shape `(batch_size, unprocessed_length)` instead of all `input_ids`
  of shape `(batch_size, sequence_length)`.
* **inputs\_embeds** (`torch.FloatTensor` of shape `(batch_size, sequence_length, hidden_size)`, *optional*) —
  Optionally, instead of passing `input_ids` you can choose to directly pass an embedded representation. This
  is useful if you want more control over how to convert `input_ids` indices into associated vectors than the
  model’s internal embedding lookup matrix.
* **decoder\_inputs\_embeds** (`torch.FloatTensor` of shape `(batch_size, target_sequence_length, hidden_size)`, *optional*) —
  Optionally, instead of passing `decoder_input_ids` you can choose to directly pass an embedded
  representation. If `past_key_values` is used, optionally only the last `decoder_inputs_embeds` have to be
  input (see `past_key_values`). This is useful if you want more control over how to convert
  `decoder_input_ids` indices into associated vectors than the model’s internal embedding lookup matrix.

  If `decoder_input_ids` and `decoder_inputs_embeds` are both unset, `decoder_inputs_embeds` takes the value
  of `inputs_embeds`.
* **labels** (`torch.LongTensor` of shape `(batch_size, sequence_length)`, *optional*) —
  Labels for computing the masked language modeling loss. Indices should either be in `[0, ..., config.vocab_size]` or -100 (see `input_ids` docstring). Tokens with indices set to `-100` are ignored
  (masked), the loss is only computed for the tokens with labels in `[0, ..., config.vocab_size]`.
* **use\_cache** (`bool`, *optional*) —
  If set to `True`, `past_key_values` key value states are returned and can be used to speed up decoding (see
  `past_key_values`).
* **output\_attentions** (`bool`, *optional*) —
  Whether or not to return the attentions tensors of all attention layers. See `attentions` under returned
  tensors for more detail.
* **output\_hidden\_states** (`bool`, *optional*) —
  Whether or not to return the hidden states of all layers. See `hidden_states` under returned tensors for
  more detail.
* **return\_dict** (`bool`, *optional*) —
  Whether or not to return a [ModelOutput](/docs/transformers/v4.56.2/en/main_classes/output#transformers.utils.ModelOutput) instead of a plain tuple.
* **cache\_position** (`torch.LongTensor` of shape `(sequence_length)`, *optional*) —
  Indices depicting the position of the input sequence tokens in the sequence. Contrarily to `position_ids`,
  this tensor is not affected by padding. It is used to update the cache in the correct position and to infer
  the complete sequence length.

instance afterwards instead of this since the former takes care of running the pre and post processing steps while
the latter silently ignores them.

  Indices of input sequence tokens in the vocabulary. Padding will be ignored by default.

  Indices can be obtained using [AutoTokenizer](/docs/transformers/v4.56.2/en/model_doc/auto#transformers.AutoTokenizer). See [PreTrainedTokenizer.encode()](/docs/transformers/v4.56.2/en/internal/tokenization_utils#transformers.PreTrainedTokenizerBase.encode) and
  [PreTrainedTokenizer.**call**()](/docs/transformers/v4.56.2/en/internal/tokenization_utils#transformers.PreTrainedTokenizerBase.__call__) for details.

  [What are input IDs?](../glossary#input-ids)
* **attention\_mask** (`torch.Tensor` of shape `(batch_size, sequence_length)`, *optional*) —
  Mask to avoid performing attention on padding token indices. Mask values selected in `[0, 1]`:
  + 1 for tokens that are **not masked**,
  + 0 for tokens that are **masked**.

  [What are attention masks?](../glossary#attention-mask)
* **decoder\_input\_ids** (`torch.LongTensor` of shape `(batch_size, target_sequence_length)`, *optional*) —
  Provide for translation and summarization training. By default, the model will create this tensor by
  shifting the `input_ids` to the right, following the paper.
* **decoder\_attention\_mask** (`torch.LongTensor` of shape `(batch_size, target_sequence_length)`, *optional*) —
  Default behavior: generate a tensor that ignores pad tokens in `decoder_input_ids`. Causal mask will also
  be used by default.

  If you want to change padding behavior, you should read
  `modeling_bigbird_pegasus._prepare_decoder_attention_mask` and modify to your needs. See diagram 1 in
  [the paper](https://huggingface.co/papers/1910.13461) for more information on the default strategy.
* **head\_mask** (`torch.Tensor` of shape `(num_heads,)` or `(num_layers, num_heads)`, *optional*) —
  Mask to nullify selected heads of the self-attention modules. Mask values selected in `[0, 1]`:
  + 1 indicates the head is **not masked**,
  + 0 indicates the head is **masked**.
* **decoder\_head\_mask** (`torch.Tensor` of shape `(num_layers, num_heads)`, *optional*) —
  Mask to nullify selected heads of the attention modules in the decoder. Mask values selected in `[0, 1]`:
  + 1 indicates the head is **not masked**,
  + 0 indicates the head is **masked**.
* **cross\_attn\_head\_mask** (`torch.Tensor` of shape `(num_layers, num_heads)`, *optional*) —
  Mask to nullify selected heads of the cross-attention modules. Mask values selected in `[0, 1]`:
  + 1 indicates the head is **not masked**,
  + 0 indicates the head is **masked**.
* **encoder\_outputs** (`list[torch.FloatTensor]`, *optional*) —
  Tuple consists of (`last_hidden_state`, *optional*: `hidden_states`, *optional*: `attentions`)
  `last_hidden_state` of shape `(batch_size, sequence_length, hidden_size)`, *optional*) is a sequence of
  hidden-states at the output of the last layer of the encoder. Used in the cross-attention of the decoder.
* **start\_positions** (`torch.LongTensor` of shape `(batch_size,)`, *optional*) —
  Labels for position (index) of the start of the labelled span for computing the token classification loss.
  Positions are clamped to the length of the sequence (`sequence_length`). Position outside of the sequence
  are not taken into account for computing the loss.
* **end\_positions** (`torch.LongTensor` of shape `(batch_size,)`, *optional*) —
  Labels for position (index) of the end of the labelled span for computing the token classification loss.
  Positions are clamped to the length of the sequence (`sequence_length`). Position outside of the sequence
  are not taken into account for computing the loss.
* **inputs\_embeds** (`torch.FloatTensor` of shape `(batch_size, sequence_length, hidden_size)`, *optional*) —
  Optionally, instead of passing `input_ids` you can choose to directly pass an embedded representation. This
  is useful if you want more control over how to convert `input_ids` indices into associated vectors than the
  model’s internal embedding lookup matrix.
* **decoder\_inputs\_embeds** (`torch.FloatTensor` of shape `(batch_size, target_sequence_length, hidden_size)`, *optional*) —
  Optionally, instead of passing `decoder_input_ids` you can choose to directly pass an embedded
  representation. If `past_key_values` is used, optionally only the last `decoder_inputs_embeds` have to be
  input (see `past_key_values`). This is useful if you want more control over how to convert
  `decoder_input_ids` indices into associated vectors than the model’s internal embedding lookup matrix.

  If `decoder_input_ids` and `decoder_inputs_embeds` are both unset, `decoder_inputs_embeds` takes the value
  of `inputs_embeds`.
* **use\_cache** (`bool`, *optional*) —
  If set to `True`, `past_key_values` key value states are returned and can be used to speed up decoding (see
  `past_key_values`).
* **output\_attentions** (`bool`, *optional*) —
  Whether or not to return the attentions tensors of all attention layers. See `attentions` under returned
  tensors for more detail.
* **output\_hidden\_states** (`bool`, *optional*) —
  Whether or not to return the hidden states of all layers. See `hidden_states` under returned tensors for
  more detail.
* **return\_dict** (`bool`, *optional*) —
  Whether or not to return a [ModelOutput](/docs/transformers/v4.56.2/en/main_classes/output#transformers.utils.ModelOutput) instead of a plain tuple.
* **cache\_position** (`torch.LongTensor` of shape `(sequence_length)`, *optional*) —
  Indices depicting the position of the input sequence tokens in the sequence. Contrarily to `position_ids`,
  this tensor is not affected by padding. It is used to update the cache in the correct position and to infer
  the complete sequence length.

The [BigBirdPegasusForQuestionAnswering](/docs/transformers/v4.56.2/en/model_doc/bigbird_pegasus#transformers.BigBirdPegasusForQuestionAnswering) forward method, overrides the `__call__` special method.

Although the recipe for forward pass needs to be defined within this function, one should call the `Module`
instance afterwards instead of this since the former takes care of running the pre and post processing steps while
the latter silently ignores them.

Example:


```
>>> from transformers import AutoTokenizer, BigBirdPegasusForQuestionAnswering
>>> import torch

>>> tokenizer = AutoTokenizer.from_pretrained("google/bigbird-pegasus-large-arxiv")
>>> model = BigBirdPegasusForQuestionAnswering.from_pretrained("google/bigbird-pegasus-large-arxiv")

>>> question, text = "Who was Jim Henson?", "Jim Henson was a nice puppet"

Parameters

* **input\_ids** (`torch.LongTensor` of shape `(batch_size, sequence_length)`, *optional*) —
  Indices of input sequence tokens in the vocabulary. Padding will be ignored by default.

  Indices can be obtained using [AutoTokenizer](/docs/transformers/v4.56.2/en/model_doc/auto#transformers.AutoTokenizer). See [PreTrainedTokenizer.encode()](/docs/transformers/v4.56.2/en/internal/tokenization_utils#transformers.PreTrainedTokenizerBase.encode) and

  [What are input IDs?](../glossary#input-ids)
* **attention\_mask** (`torch.Tensor` of shape `(batch_size, sequence_length)`, *optional*) —
  Mask to avoid performing attention on padding token indices. Mask values selected in `[0, 1]`:
  + 1 for tokens that are **not masked**,

  returned by the model at a previous stage of decoding, when `use_cache=True` or `config.use_cache=True`.

  Only [Cache](/docs/transformers/v4.56.2/en/internal/generation_utils#transformers.Cache) instance is allowed as input, see our [kv cache guide](https://huggingface.co/docs/transformers/en/kv_cache).

  The model will output the same cache format that is fed as input.

  If `past_key_values` are used, the user is expected to input only unprocessed `input_ids` (those that don’t
  have their past key value states given to this model) of shape `(batch_size, unprocessed_length)` instead of all `input_ids`
  of shape `(batch_size, sequence_length)`.
* **inputs\_embeds** (`torch.FloatTensor` of shape `(batch_size, sequence_length, hidden_size)`, *optional*) —

  Whether or not to return the attentions tensors of all attention layers. See `attentions` under returned
  tensors for more detail.
* **output\_hidden\_states** (`bool`, *optional*) —

  more detail.
* **return\_dict** (`bool`, *optional*) —

* **cache\_position** (`torch.LongTensor` of shape `(sequence_length)`, *optional*) —
  Indices depicting the position of the input sequence tokens in the sequence. Contrarily to `position_ids`,
  this tensor is not affected by padding. It is used to update the cache in the correct position and to infer
