# SqueezeBERT

![PyTorch](https://img.shields.io/badge/PyTorch-DE3412?style=flat&logo=pytorch&logoColor=white)

## Overview

The SqueezeBERT model was proposed in [SqueezeBERT: What can computer vision teach NLP about efficient neural networks?](https://huggingface.co/papers/2006.11316) by Forrest N. Iandola, Albert E. Shaw, Ravi Krishna, Kurt W. Keutzer. It’s a
bidirectional transformer similar to the BERT model. The key difference between the BERT architecture and the
SqueezeBERT architecture is that SqueezeBERT uses [grouped convolutions](https://blog.yani.io/filter-group-tutorial)
instead of fully-connected layers for the Q, K, V and FFN layers.

The abstract from the paper is the following:

*Humans read and write hundreds of billions of messages every day. Further, due to the availability of large datasets,
large computing systems, and better neural network models, natural language processing (NLP) technology has made
significant strides in understanding, proofreading, and organizing these messages. Thus, there is a significant
opportunity to deploy NLP in myriad applications to help web users, social networks, and businesses. In particular, we
consider smartphones and other mobile devices as crucial platforms for deploying NLP models at scale. However, today’s
highly-accurate NLP neural network models such as BERT and RoBERTa are extremely computationally expensive, with
BERT-base taking 1.7 seconds to classify a text snippet on a Pixel 3 smartphone. In this work, we observe that methods
such as grouped convolutions have yielded significant speedups for computer vision networks, but many of these
techniques have not been adopted by NLP neural network designers. We demonstrate how to replace several operations in
self-attention layers with grouped convolutions, and we use this technique in a novel network architecture called
SqueezeBERT, which runs 4.3x faster than BERT-base on the Pixel 3 while achieving competitive accuracy on the GLUE test
set. The SqueezeBERT code will be released.*

This model was contributed by [forresti](https://huggingface.co/forresti).

## Usage tips

* SqueezeBERT is a model with absolute position embeddings so it’s usually advised to pad the inputs on the right
  rather than the left.
* SqueezeBERT is similar to BERT and therefore relies on the masked language modeling (MLM) objective. It is therefore
  efficient at predicting masked tokens and at NLU in general, but is not optimal for text generation. Models trained
  with a causal language modeling (CLM) objective are better in that regard.
* For best results when finetuning on sequence classification tasks, it is recommended to start with the
  *squeezebert/squeezebert-mnli-headless* checkpoint.

This is the configuration class to store the configuration of a [SqueezeBertModel](/docs/transformers/v4.56.2/en/model_doc/squeezebert#transformers.SqueezeBertModel). It is used to instantiate a
SqueezeBERT model according to the specified arguments, defining the model architecture. Instantiating a
configuration with the defaults will yield a similar configuration to that of the SqueezeBERT
[squeezebert/squeezebert-uncased](https://huggingface.co/squeezebert/squeezebert-uncased) architecture.

Configuration objects inherit from [PretrainedConfig](/docs/transformers/v4.56.2/en/main_classes/configuration#transformers.PretrainedConfig) and can be used to control the model outputs. Read the
documentation from [PretrainedConfig](/docs/transformers/v4.56.2/en/main_classes/configuration#transformers.PretrainedConfig) for more information.

Examples:


```
>>> from transformers import SqueezeBertConfig, SqueezeBertModel

>>> # Initializing a SqueezeBERT configuration
>>> configuration = SqueezeBertConfig()

>>> # Initializing a model (with random weights) from the configuration above
>>> model = SqueezeBertModel(configuration)

>>> # Accessing the model configuration
>>> configuration = model.config
```

* **inputs\_embeds** (`torch.FloatTensor` of shape `(batch_size, sequence_length, hidden_size)`, *optional*) —
  Optionally, instead of passing `input_ids` you can choose to directly pass an embedded representation. This

`torch.FloatTensor` (if `return_dict=False` is passed or when `config.return_dict=False`) comprising various
elements depending on the configuration ([SqueezeBertConfig](/docs/transformers/v4.56.2/en/model_doc/squeezebert#transformers.SqueezeBertConfig)) and inputs.

* **pooler\_output** (`torch.FloatTensor` of shape `(batch_size, hidden_size)`) — Last layer hidden-state of the first token of the sequence (classification token) after further processing
  through the layers used for the auxiliary pretraining task. E.g. for BERT-family of models, this returns
  the classification token after processing through a linear layer and a tanh activation function. The linear
  layer weights are trained from the next sentence prediction (classification) objective during pretraining.
* **hidden\_states** (`tuple(torch.FloatTensor)`, *optional*, returned when `output_hidden_states=True` is passed or when `config.output_hidden_states=True`) — Tuple of `torch.FloatTensor` (one for the output of the embeddings, if the model has an embedding layer, +
  one for the output of each layer) of shape `(batch_size, sequence_length, hidden_size)`.

  Hidden-states of the model at the output of each layer plus the optional initial embedding outputs.

  Attentions weights after the attention softmax, used to compute the weighted average in the self-attention
  heads.

The [SqueezeBertModel](/docs/transformers/v4.56.2/en/model_doc/squeezebert#transformers.SqueezeBertModel) forward method, overrides the `__call__` special method.

Although the recipe for forward pass needs to be defined within this function, one should call the `Module`
instance afterwards instead of this since the former takes care of running the pre and post processing steps while
the latter silently ignores them.

A [transformers.modeling\_outputs.MaskedLMOutput](/docs/transformers/v4.56.2/en/main_classes/output#transformers.modeling_outputs.MaskedLMOutput) or a tuple of
`torch.FloatTensor` (if `return_dict=False` is passed or when `config.return_dict=False`) comprising various
elements depending on the configuration ([SqueezeBertConfig](/docs/transformers/v4.56.2/en/model_doc/squeezebert#transformers.SqueezeBertConfig)) and inputs.

* **loss** (`torch.FloatTensor` of shape `(1,)`, *optional*, returned when `labels` is provided) — Masked language modeling (MLM) loss.

  heads.

The [SqueezeBertForMaskedLM](/docs/transformers/v4.56.2/en/model_doc/squeezebert#transformers.SqueezeBertForMaskedLM) forward method, overrides the `__call__` special method.

Although the recipe for forward pass needs to be defined within this function, one should call the `Module`
instance afterwards instead of this since the former takes care of running the pre and post processing steps while
the latter silently ignores them.

Example:


```
>>> from transformers import AutoTokenizer, SqueezeBertForMaskedLM
>>> import torch

>>> tokenizer = AutoTokenizer.from_pretrained("squeezebert/squeezebert-uncased")
>>> model = SqueezeBertForMaskedLM.from_pretrained("squeezebert/squeezebert-uncased")

>>> inputs = tokenizer("The capital of France is <mask>.", return_tensors="pt")

>>> with torch.no_grad():
...     logits = model(**inputs).logits

>>> # retrieve index of <mask>
>>> mask_token_index = (inputs.input_ids == tokenizer.mask_token_id)[0].nonzero(as_tuple=True)[0]

>>> predicted_token_id = logits[0, mask_token_index].argmax(axis=-1)
>>> tokenizer.decode(predicted_token_id)
...

>>> labels = tokenizer("The capital of France is Paris.", return_tensors="pt")["input_ids"]
>>> # mask labels of non-<mask> tokens
>>> labels = torch.where(inputs.input_ids == tokenizer.mask_token_id, labels, -100)

  Whether or not to return the hidden states of all layers. See `hidden_states` under returned tensors for
  more detail.
* **return\_dict** (`bool`, *optional*) —
  Whether or not to return a [ModelOutput](/docs/transformers/v4.56.2/en/main_classes/output#transformers.utils.ModelOutput) instead of a plain tuple.

Returns

[transformers.modeling\_outputs.TokenClassifierOutput](/docs/transformers/v4.56.2/en/main_classes/output#transformers.modeling_outputs.TokenClassifierOutput) or `tuple(torch.FloatTensor)`

A [transformers.modeling\_outputs.TokenClassifierOutput](/docs/transformers/v4.56.2/en/main_classes/output#transformers.modeling_outputs.TokenClassifierOutput) or a tuple of
`torch.FloatTensor` (if `return_dict=False` is passed or when `config.return_dict=False`) comprising various
elements depending on the configuration ([SqueezeBertConfig](/docs/transformers/v4.56.2/en/model_doc/squeezebert#transformers.SqueezeBertConfig)) and inputs.

* **loss** (`torch.FloatTensor` of shape `(1,)`, *optional*, returned when `labels` is provided) — Classification loss.
* **logits** (`torch.FloatTensor` of shape `(batch_size, sequence_length, config.num_labels)`) — Classification scores (before SoftMax).
* **hidden\_states** (`tuple(torch.FloatTensor)`, *optional*, returned when `output_hidden_states=True` is passed or when `config.output_hidden_states=True`) — Tuple of `torch.FloatTensor` (one for the output of the embeddings, if the model has an embedding layer, +
  one for the output of each layer) of shape `(batch_size, sequence_length, hidden_size)`.

  Hidden-states of the model at the output of each layer plus the optional initial embedding outputs.
* **attentions** (`tuple(torch.FloatTensor)`, *optional*, returned when `output_attentions=True` is passed or when `config.output_attentions=True`) — Tuple of `torch.FloatTensor` (one for each layer) of shape `(batch_size, num_heads, sequence_length, sequence_length)`.

  Attentions weights after the attention softmax, used to compute the weighted average in the self-attention
  heads.

The [SqueezeBertForTokenClassification](/docs/transformers/v4.56.2/en/model_doc/squeezebert#transformers.SqueezeBertForTokenClassification) forward method, overrides the `__call__` special method.

Although the recipe for forward pass needs to be defined within this function, one should call the `Module`
instance afterwards instead of this since the former takes care of running the pre and post processing steps while
the latter silently ignores them.

Example:


```
>>> from transformers import AutoTokenizer, SqueezeBertForTokenClassification
>>> import torch

>>> tokenizer = AutoTokenizer.from_pretrained("squeezebert/squeezebert-uncased")
>>> model = SqueezeBertForTokenClassification.from_pretrained("squeezebert/squeezebert-uncased")

>>> inputs = tokenizer(
...     "HuggingFace is a company based in Paris and New York", add_special_tokens=False, return_tensors="pt"
... )

>>> with torch.no_grad():
...     logits = model(**inputs).logits

>>> predicted_token_class_ids = logits.argmax(-1)

>>> # Note that tokens are classified rather then input words which means that
>>> # there might be more predicted token classes than words.
>>> # Multiple token classes might account for the same word
>>> predicted_tokens_classes = [model.config.id2label[t.item()] for t in predicted_token_class_ids[0]]
>>> predicted_tokens_classes
...

>>> labels = predicted_token_class_ids
>>> loss = model(**inputs, labels=labels).loss
>>> round(loss.item(), 2)
...
```

### class transformers.SqueezeBertForQuestionAnswering

 [< source >](https://github.com/huggingface/transformers/blob/v4.56.2/src/transformers/models/squeezebert/modeling_squeezebert.py#L876)

( config  )

Parameters

* **config** ([SqueezeBertForQuestionAnswering](/docs/transformers/v4.56.2/en/model_doc/squeezebert#transformers.SqueezeBertForQuestionAnswering)) —
  Model configuration class with all the parameters of the model. Initializing with a config file does not
  load the weights associated with the model, only the configuration. Check out the
  [from\_pretrained()](/docs/transformers/v4.56.2/en/main_classes/model#transformers.PreTrainedModel.from_pretrained) method to load the model weights.

The Squeezebert transformer with a span classification head on top for extractive question-answering tasks like
SQuAD (a linear layer on top of the hidden-states output to compute `span start logits` and `span end logits`).

This model inherits from [PreTrainedModel](/docs/transformers/v4.56.2/en/main_classes/model#transformers.PreTrainedModel). Check the superclass documentation for the generic methods the
library implements for all its model (such as downloading or saving, resizing the input embeddings, pruning heads
etc.)

This model is also a PyTorch [torch.nn.Module](https://pytorch.org/docs/stable/nn.html#torch.nn.Module) subclass.
Use it as a regular PyTorch Module and refer to the PyTorch documentation for all matter related to general usage
and behavior.

Parameters

* **input\_ids** (`torch.Tensor` of shape `(batch_size, sequence_length)`, *optional*) —
  Indices of input sequence tokens in the vocabulary. Padding will be ignored by default.

  Indices can be obtained using [AutoTokenizer](/docs/transformers/v4.56.2/en/model_doc/auto#transformers.AutoTokenizer). See [PreTrainedTokenizer.encode()](/docs/transformers/v4.56.2/en/internal/tokenization_utils#transformers.PreTrainedTokenizerBase.encode) and
  [PreTrainedTokenizer.**call**()](/docs/transformers/v4.56.2/en/internal/tokenization_utils#transformers.PreTrainedTokenizerBase.__call__) for details.

  [What are input IDs?](../glossary#input-ids)
* **attention\_mask** (`torch.Tensor` of shape `(batch_size, sequence_length)`, *optional*) —
  Mask to avoid performing attention on padding token indices. Mask values selected in `[0, 1]`:
  + 1 for tokens that are **not masked**,
  + 0 for tokens that are **masked**.

  [What are attention masks?](../glossary#attention-mask)
* **token\_type\_ids** (`torch.Tensor` of shape `(batch_size, sequence_length)`, *optional*) —
  Segment token indices to indicate first and second portions of the inputs. Indices are selected in `[0, 1]`:
  + 0 corresponds to a *sentence A* token,
  + 1 corresponds to a *sentence B* token.

  [What are token type IDs?](../glossary#token-type-ids)
* **position\_ids** (`torch.Tensor` of shape `(batch_size, sequence_length)`, *optional*) —
  Indices of positions of each input sequence tokens in the position embeddings. Selected in the range `[0, config.n_positions - 1]`.

  [What are position IDs?](../glossary#position-ids)
* **head\_mask** (`torch.Tensor` of shape `(num_heads,)` or `(num_layers, num_heads)`, *optional*) —
  Mask to nullify selected heads of the self-attention modules. Mask values selected in `[0, 1]`:
  + 1 indicates the head is **not masked**,
  + 0 indicates the head is **masked**.
* **inputs\_embeds** (`torch.Tensor` of shape `(batch_size, sequence_length, hidden_size)`, *optional*) —
  Optionally, instead of passing `input_ids` you can choose to directly pass an embedded representation. This
  is useful if you want more control over how to convert `input_ids` indices into associated vectors than the
  model’s internal embedding lookup matrix.
* **start\_positions** (`torch.Tensor` of shape `(batch_size,)`, *optional*) —
  Labels for position (index) of the start of the labelled span for computing the token classification loss.
  Positions are clamped to the length of the sequence (`sequence_length`). Position outside of the sequence
  are not taken into account for computing the loss.
* **end\_positions** (`torch.Tensor` of shape `(batch_size,)`, *optional*) —
  Labels for position (index) of the end of the labelled span for computing the token classification loss.
  Positions are clamped to the length of the sequence (`sequence_length`). Position outside of the sequence
  are not taken into account for computing the loss.
* **output\_attentions** (`bool`, *optional*) —
  Whether or not to return the attentions tensors of all attention layers. See `attentions` under returned
  tensors for more detail.
* **output\_hidden\_states** (`bool`, *optional*) —
  Whether or not to return the hidden states of all layers. See `hidden_states` under returned tensors for
  more detail.
* **return\_dict** (`bool`, *optional*) —
  Whether or not to return a [ModelOutput](/docs/transformers/v4.56.2/en/main_classes/output#transformers.utils.ModelOutput) instead of a plain tuple.
