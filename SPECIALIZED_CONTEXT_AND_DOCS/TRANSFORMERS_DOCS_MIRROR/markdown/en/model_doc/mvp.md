# MVP

![PyTorch](https://img.shields.io/badge/PyTorch-DE3412?style=flat&logo=pytorch&logoColor=white)

## Overview

The MVP model was proposed in [MVP: Multi-task Supervised Pre-training for Natural Language Generation](https://huggingface.co/papers/2206.12131) by Tianyi Tang, Junyi Li, Wayne Xin Zhao and Ji-Rong Wen.

According to the abstract,

* MVP follows a standard Transformer encoder-decoder architecture.
* MVP is supervised pre-trained using labeled datasets.
* MVP also has task-specific soft prompts to stimulate the model’s capacity in performing a certain task.
* MVP is specially designed for natural language generation and can be adapted to a wide range of generation tasks, including but not limited to summarization, data-to-text generation, open-ended dialogue system, story generation, question answering, question generation, task-oriented dialogue system, commonsense generation, paraphrase generation, text style transfer, and text simplification. Our model can also be adapted to natural language understanding tasks such as sequence classification and (extractive) question answering.

This model was contributed by [Tianyi Tang](https://huggingface.co/StevenTang). The detailed information and instructions can be found [here](https://github.com/RUCAIBox/MVP).

## Usage tips

* We have released a series of models [here](https://huggingface.co/models?filter=mvp), including MVP, MVP with task-specific prompts, and multi-task pre-trained variants.
* If you want to use a model without prompts (standard Transformer), you can load it through `MvpForConditionalGeneration.from_pretrained('RUCAIBox/mvp')`.
* If you want to use a model with task-specific prompts, such as summarization, you can load it through `MvpForConditionalGeneration.from_pretrained('RUCAIBox/mvp-summarization')`.
* Our model supports lightweight prompt tuning following [Prefix-tuning](https://huggingface.co/papers/2101.00190) with method `set_lightweight_tuning()`.

## Usage examples

For summarization, it is an example to use MVP and MVP with summarization-specific prompts.


```
>>> from transformers import MvpTokenizer, MvpForConditionalGeneration

>>> tokenizer = MvpTokenizer.from_pretrained("RUCAIBox/mvp")
>>> model = MvpForConditionalGeneration.from_pretrained("RUCAIBox/mvp")
>>> model_with_prompt = MvpForConditionalGeneration.from_pretrained("RUCAIBox/mvp-summarization")

>>> inputs = tokenizer(
...     "Summarize: You may want to stick it to your boss and leave your job, but don't do it if these are your reasons.",
...     return_tensors="pt",
... )
>>> generated_ids = model.generate(**inputs)
>>> tokenizer.batch_decode(generated_ids, skip_special_tokens=True)
["Why You Shouldn't Quit Your Job"]

>>> generated_ids = model_with_prompt.generate(**inputs)
>>> tokenizer.batch_decode(generated_ids, skip_special_tokens=True)
["Don't do it if these are your reasons"]
```

For data-to-text generation, it is an example to use MVP and multi-task pre-trained variants.


```
>>> from transformers import MvpTokenizerFast, MvpForConditionalGeneration

>>> tokenizer = MvpTokenizerFast.from_pretrained("RUCAIBox/mvp")
>>> model = MvpForConditionalGeneration.from_pretrained("RUCAIBox/mvp")
>>> model_with_mtl = MvpForConditionalGeneration.from_pretrained("RUCAIBox/mtl-data-to-text")

>>> inputs = tokenizer(
...     "Describe the following data: Iron Man | instance of | Superhero [SEP] Stan Lee | creator | Iron Man",
...     return_tensors="pt",
... )
>>> generated_ids = model.generate(**inputs)
>>> tokenizer.batch_decode(generated_ids, skip_special_tokens=True)
['Stan Lee created the character of Iron Man, a fictional superhero appearing in American comic']

>>> generated_ids = model_with_mtl.generate(**inputs)
>>> tokenizer.batch_decode(generated_ids, skip_special_tokens=True)
['Iron Man is a fictional superhero appearing in American comic books published by Marvel Comics.']
```

For lightweight tuning, *i.e.*, fixing the model and only tuning prompts, you can load MVP with randomly initialized prompts or with task-specific prompts. Our code also supports Prefix-tuning with BART following the [original paper](https://huggingface.co/papers/2101.00190).


```
>>> from transformers import MvpForConditionalGeneration

>>> model = MvpForConditionalGeneration.from_pretrained("RUCAIBox/mvp", use_prompt=True)
>>> # the number of trainable parameters (full tuning)
>>> sum(p.numel() for p in model.parameters() if p.requires_grad)
468116832

>>> # lightweight tuning with randomly initialized prompts
>>> model.set_lightweight_tuning()
>>> # the number of trainable parameters (lightweight tuning)
>>> sum(p.numel() for p in model.parameters() if p.requires_grad)
61823328

>>> # lightweight tuning with task-specific prompts
>>> model = MvpForConditionalGeneration.from_pretrained("RUCAIBox/mtl-data-to-text")
>>> model.set_lightweight_tuning()
>>> # original lightweight Prefix-tuning
>>> model = MvpForConditionalGeneration.from_pretrained("facebook/bart-large", use_prompt=True)
>>> model.set_lightweight_tuning()
```

This is the configuration class to store the configuration of a [MvpModel](/docs/transformers/v4.56.2/en/model_doc/mvp#transformers.MvpModel). It is used to instantiate a MVP model
according to the specified arguments, defining the model architecture. Instantiating a configuration with the
defaults will yield a similar configuration to that of the MVP [RUCAIBox/mvp](https://huggingface.co/RUCAIBox/mvp)
architecture.

Configuration objects inherit from [PretrainedConfig](/docs/transformers/v4.56.2/en/main_classes/configuration#transformers.PretrainedConfig) and can be used to control the model outputs. Read the
documentation from [PretrainedConfig](/docs/transformers/v4.56.2/en/main_classes/configuration#transformers.PretrainedConfig) for more information.

Example:


```
>>> from transformers import MvpConfig, MvpModel

>>> # Initializing a MVP RUCAIBox/mvp style configuration
>>> configuration = MvpConfig()

>>> # Initializing a model (with random weights) from the RUCAIBox/mvp style configuration
>>> model = MvpModel(configuration)

>>> # Accessing the model configuration
>>> configuration = model.config
```

## MvpTokenizer

### class transformers.MvpTokenizer

 [< source >](https://github.com/huggingface/transformers/blob/v4.56.2/src/transformers/models/mvp/tokenization_mvp.py#L74)

( vocab\_file merges\_file errors = 'replace' bos\_token = '<s>' eos\_token = '</s>' sep\_token = '</s>' cls\_token = '<s>' unk\_token = '<unk>' pad\_token = '<pad>' mask\_token = '<mask>' add\_prefix\_space = False \*\*kwargs  )

Parameters

* **vocab\_file** (`str`) —
  Path to the vocabulary file.
* **merges\_file** (`str`) —
  Path to the merges file.
* **errors** (`str`, *optional*, defaults to `"replace"`) —
  Paradigm to follow when decoding bytes to UTF-8. See
  [bytes.decode](https://docs.python.org/3/library/stdtypes.html#bytes.decode) for more information.
* **bos\_token** (`str`, *optional*, defaults to `"<s>"`) —
  The beginning of sequence token that was used during pretraining. Can be used a sequence classifier token.

  When building a sequence using special tokens, this is not the token that is used for the beginning of
  sequence. The token used is the `cls_token`.
* **eos\_token** (`str`, *optional*, defaults to `"</s>"`) —
  The end of sequence token.

  When building a sequence using special tokens, this is not the token that is used for the end of sequence.
  The token used is the `sep_token`.
* **sep\_token** (`str`, *optional*, defaults to `"</s>"`) —
  The separator token, which is used when building a sequence from multiple sequences, e.g. two sequences for
  sequence classification or for a text and a question for question answering. It is also used as the last
  token of a sequence built with special tokens.
* **cls\_token** (`str`, *optional*, defaults to `"<s>"`) —
  The classifier token which is used when doing sequence classification (classification of the whole sequence
  instead of per-token classification). It is the first token of the sequence when built with special tokens.
* **unk\_token** (`str`, *optional*, defaults to `"<unk>"`) —
  The unknown token. A token that is not in the vocabulary cannot be converted to an ID and is set to be this
  token instead.
* **pad\_token** (`str`, *optional*, defaults to `"<pad>"`) —
  The token used for padding, for example when batching sequences of different lengths.
* **mask\_token** (`str`, *optional*, defaults to `"<mask>"`) —
  The token used for masking values. This is the token used when training this model with masked language
  modeling. This is the token which the model will try to predict.
* **add\_prefix\_space** (`bool`, *optional*, defaults to `False`) —
  Whether or not to add an initial space to the input. This allows to treat the leading word just as any
  other word. (MVP tokenizer detect beginning of words by the preceding space).

Constructs a MVP tokenizer, which is smilar to the RoBERTa tokenizer, using byte-level Byte-Pair-Encoding.

This tokenizer has been trained to treat spaces like parts of the tokens (a bit like sentencepiece) so a word will

be encoded differently whether it is at the beginning of the sentence (without space) or not:


```
>>> from transformers import MvpTokenizer

>>> tokenizer = MvpTokenizer.from_pretrained("RUCAIBox/mvp")
>>> tokenizer("Hello world")["input_ids"]
[0, 31414, 232, 2]

>>> tokenizer(" Hello world")["input_ids"]
[0, 20920, 232, 2]
```

You can get around that behavior by passing `add_prefix_space=True` when instantiating this tokenizer or when you
call it on some text, but since the model was not pretrained this way, it might yield a decrease in performance.

When used with `is_split_into_words=True`, this tokenizer will add a space before each word (even the first one).

This tokenizer inherits from [PreTrainedTokenizer](/docs/transformers/v4.56.2/en/main_classes/tokenizer#transformers.PreTrainedTokenizer) which contains most of the main methods. Users should refer to
this superclass for more information regarding those methods.

Construct a “fast” MVP tokenizer (backed by HuggingFace’s *tokenizers* library), derived from the GPT-2 tokenizer,
using byte-level Byte-Pair-Encoding.

This tokenizer has been trained to treat spaces like parts of the tokens (a bit like sentencepiece) so a word will

be encoded differently whether it is at the beginning of the sentence (without space) or not:


```
>>> from transformers import MvpTokenizerFast

>>> tokenizer = MvpTokenizerFast.from_pretrained("RUCAIBox/mvp")
>>> tokenizer("Hello world")["input_ids"]
[0, 31414, 232, 2]

>>> tokenizer(" Hello world")["input_ids"]
[0, 20920, 232, 2]
```

You can get around that behavior by passing `add_prefix_space=True` when instantiating this tokenizer or when you
call it on some text, but since the model was not pretrained this way, it might yield a decrease in performance.

When used with `is_split_into_words=True`, this tokenizer needs to be instantiated with `add_prefix_space=True`.

This tokenizer inherits from [PreTrainedTokenizerFast](/docs/transformers/v4.56.2/en/main_classes/tokenizer#transformers.PreTrainedTokenizerFast) which contains most of the main methods. Users should

 [< source >](https://github.com/huggingface/transformers/blob/v4.56.2/src/transformers/models/mvp/modeling_mvp.py#L962)

( config: MvpConfig  )

Parameters

* **config** ([MvpConfig](/docs/transformers/v4.56.2/en/model_doc/mvp#transformers.MvpConfig)) —
  Model configuration class with all the parameters of the model. Initializing with a config file does not
  load the weights associated with the model, only the configuration. Check out the
  [from\_pretrained()](/docs/transformers/v4.56.2/en/main_classes/model#transformers.PreTrainedModel.from_pretrained) method to load the model weights.

The bare Mvp Model outputting raw hidden-states without any specific head on top.

This model inherits from [PreTrainedModel](/docs/transformers/v4.56.2/en/main_classes/model#transformers.PreTrainedModel). Check the superclass documentation for the generic methods the
library implements for all its model (such as downloading or saving, resizing the input embeddings, pruning heads
etc.)

This model is also a PyTorch [torch.nn.Module](https://pytorch.org/docs/stable/nn.html#torch.nn.Module) subclass.
Use it as a regular PyTorch Module and refer to the PyTorch documentation for all matter related to general usage
and behavior.

#### forward

( input\_ids: typing.Optional[torch.LongTensor] = None attention\_mask: typing.Optional[torch.Tensor] = None decoder\_input\_ids: typing.Optional[torch.LongTensor] = None decoder\_attention\_mask: typing.Optional[torch.LongTensor] = None head\_mask: typing.Optional[torch.Tensor] = None decoder\_head\_mask: typing.Optional[torch.Tensor] = None cross\_attn\_head\_mask: typing.Optional[torch.Tensor] = None encoder\_outputs: typing.Optional[list[torch.FloatTensor]] = None past\_key\_values: typing.Optional[list[torch.FloatTensor]] = None inputs\_embeds: typing.Optional[torch.FloatTensor] = None decoder\_inputs\_embeds: typing.Optional[torch.FloatTensor] = None use\_cache: typing.Optional[bool] = None output\_attentions: typing.Optional[bool] = None output\_hidden\_states: typing.Optional[bool] = None return\_dict: typing.Optional[bool] = None cache\_position: typing.Optional[torch.Tensor] = None  ) → [transformers.modeling\_outputs.Seq2SeqModelOutput](/docs/transformers/v4.56.2/en/main_classes/output#transformers.modeling_outputs.Seq2SeqModelOutput) or `tuple(torch.FloatTensor)`

Parameters

* **input\_ids** (`torch.LongTensor` of shape `(batch_size, sequence_length)`, *optional*) —
  Indices of input sequence tokens in the vocabulary. Padding will be ignored by default.

  Indices can be obtained using [AutoTokenizer](/docs/transformers/v4.56.2/en/model_doc/auto#transformers.AutoTokenizer). See [PreTrainedTokenizer.encode()](/docs/transformers/v4.56.2/en/internal/tokenization_utils#transformers.PreTrainedTokenizerBase.encode) and
  [PreTrainedTokenizer.**call**()](/docs/transformers/v4.56.2/en/internal/tokenization_utils#transformers.PreTrainedTokenizerBase.__call__) for details.

  [What are input IDs?](../glossary#input-ids)
* **attention\_mask** (`torch.Tensor` of shape `(batch_size, sequence_length)`, *optional*) —
  Mask to avoid performing attention on padding token indices. Mask values selected in `[0, 1]`:
  + 1 for tokens that are **not masked**,
  + 0 for tokens that are **masked**.

  [What are attention masks?](../glossary#attention-mask)
* **decoder\_input\_ids** (`torch.LongTensor` of shape `(batch_size, target_sequence_length)`, *optional*) —
  Indices of decoder input sequence tokens in the vocabulary.

  Indices can be obtained using [AutoTokenizer](/docs/transformers/v4.56.2/en/model_doc/auto#transformers.AutoTokenizer). See [PreTrainedTokenizer.encode()](/docs/transformers/v4.56.2/en/internal/tokenization_utils#transformers.PreTrainedTokenizerBase.encode) and
  [PreTrainedTokenizer.**call**()](/docs/transformers/v4.56.2/en/internal/tokenization_utils#transformers.PreTrainedTokenizerBase.__call__) for details.

  [What are decoder input IDs?](../glossary#decoder-input-ids)

  Mvp uses the `eos_token_id` as the starting token for `decoder_input_ids` generation. If `past_key_values`
  is used, optionally only the last `decoder_input_ids` have to be input (see `past_key_values`).

  For translation and summarization training, `decoder_input_ids` should be provided. If no
  `decoder_input_ids` is provided, the model will create this tensor by shifting the `input_ids` to the right
  for denoising pre-training following the paper.
* **decoder\_attention\_mask** (`torch.LongTensor` of shape `(batch_size, target_sequence_length)`, *optional*) —
  Default behavior: generate a tensor that ignores pad tokens in `decoder_input_ids`. Causal mask will also
  be used by default.

  If you want to change padding behavior, you should read `modeling_mvp._prepare_decoder_attention_mask`
  and modify to your needs. See diagram 1 in [the paper](https://huggingface.co/papers/1910.13461) for more
  information on the default strategy.
* **head\_mask** (`torch.Tensor` of shape `(num_heads,)` or `(num_layers, num_heads)`, *optional*) —
  Mask to nullify selected heads of the self-attention modules. Mask values selected in `[0, 1]`:
  + 1 indicates the head is **not masked**,
  + 0 indicates the head is **masked**.
* **decoder\_head\_mask** (`torch.Tensor` of shape `(decoder_layers, decoder_attention_heads)`, *optional*) —
  Mask to nullify selected heads of the attention modules in the decoder. Mask values selected in `[0, 1]`:
  + 1 indicates the head is **not masked**,
  + 0 indicates the head is **masked**.
* **cross\_attn\_head\_mask** (`torch.Tensor` of shape `(decoder_layers, decoder_attention_heads)`, *optional*) —
  Mask to nullify selected heads of the cross-attention modules in the decoder. Mask values selected in `[0, 1]`:
  + 1 indicates the head is **not masked**,
  + 0 indicates the head is **masked**.
* **encoder\_outputs** (`list[torch.FloatTensor]`, *optional*) —
  Tuple consists of (`last_hidden_state`, *optional*: `hidden_states`, *optional*: `attentions`)
  `last_hidden_state` of shape `(batch_size, sequence_length, hidden_size)`, *optional*) is a sequence of
  hidden-states at the output of the last layer of the encoder. Used in the cross-attention of the decoder.
* **past\_key\_values** (`list[torch.FloatTensor]`, *optional*) —
  Pre-computed hidden-states (key and values in the self-attention blocks and in the cross-attention
  blocks) that can be used to speed up sequential decoding. This typically consists in the `past_key_values`
  returned by the model at a previous stage of decoding, when `use_cache=True` or `config.use_cache=True`.

  Only [Cache](/docs/transformers/v4.56.2/en/internal/generation_utils#transformers.Cache) instance is allowed as input, see our [kv cache guide](https://huggingface.co/docs/transformers/en/kv_cache).
  If no `past_key_values` are passed, [DynamicCache](/docs/transformers/v4.56.2/en/internal/generation_utils#transformers.DynamicCache) will be initialized by default.

  The model will output the same cache format that is fed as input.

  If `past_key_values` are used, the user is expected to input only unprocessed `input_ids` (those that don’t
  have their past key value states given to this model) of shape `(batch_size, unprocessed_length)` instead of all `input_ids`
  of shape `(batch_size, sequence_length)`.
* **inputs\_embeds** (`torch.FloatTensor` of shape `(batch_size, sequence_length, hidden_size)`, *optional*) —
  Optionally, instead of passing `input_ids` you can choose to directly pass an embedded representation. This
  is useful if you want more control over how to convert `input_ids` indices into associated vectors than the
  model’s internal embedding lookup matrix.
* **decoder\_inputs\_embeds** (`torch.FloatTensor` of shape `(batch_size, target_sequence_length, hidden_size)`, *optional*) —
  Optionally, instead of passing `decoder_input_ids` you can choose to directly pass an embedded
  representation. If `past_key_values` is used, optionally only the last `decoder_inputs_embeds` have to be
  input (see `past_key_values`). This is useful if you want more control over how to convert
  `decoder_input_ids` indices into associated vectors than the model’s internal embedding lookup matrix.

  If `decoder_input_ids` and `decoder_inputs_embeds` are both unset, `decoder_inputs_embeds` takes the value
  of `inputs_embeds`.
* **use\_cache** (`bool`, *optional*) —
  If set to `True`, `past_key_values` key value states are returned and can be used to speed up decoding (see
  `past_key_values`).
* **output\_attentions** (`bool`, *optional*) —
  Whether or not to return the attentions tensors of all attention layers. See `attentions` under returned
  tensors for more detail.
* **output\_hidden\_states** (`bool`, *optional*) —
  Whether or not to return the hidden states of all layers. See `hidden_states` under returned tensors for
  more detail.
* **return\_dict** (`bool`, *optional*) —
  Whether or not to return a [ModelOutput](/docs/transformers/v4.56.2/en/main_classes/output#transformers.utils.ModelOutput) instead of a plain tuple.
* **cache\_position** (`torch.Tensor` of shape `(sequence_length)`, *optional*) —
  Indices depicting the position of the input sequence tokens in the sequence. Contrarily to `position_ids`,
  this tensor is not affected by padding. It is used to update the cache in the correct position and to infer
  the complete sequence length.

Although the recipe for forward pass needs to be defined within this function, one should call the `Module`
instance afterwards instead of this since the former takes care of running the pre and post processing steps while
the latter silently ignores them.

  [What are decoder input IDs?](../glossary#decoder-input-ids)

  Mvp uses the `eos_token_id` as the starting token for `decoder_input_ids` generation. If `past_key_values`
  is used, optionally only the last `decoder_input_ids` have to be input (see `past_key_values`).

  For translation and summarization training, `decoder_input_ids` should be provided. If no

  for denoising pre-training following the paper.
* **decoder\_attention\_mask** (`torch.LongTensor` of shape `(batch_size, target_sequence_length)`, *optional*) —
  Default behavior: generate a tensor that ignores pad tokens in `decoder_input_ids`. Causal mask will also
  be used by default.

  If you want to change padding behavior, you should read `modeling_mvp._prepare_decoder_attention_mask`
  and modify to your needs. See diagram 1 in [the paper](https://huggingface.co/papers/1910.13461) for more

The [MvpForSequenceClassification](/docs/transformers/v4.56.2/en/model_doc/mvp#transformers.MvpForSequenceClassification) forward method, overrides the `__call__` special method.

Although the recipe for forward pass needs to be defined within this function, one should call the `Module`
instance afterwards instead of this since the former takes care of running the pre and post processing steps while
the latter silently ignores them.

Example of single-label classification:

Fine-tuning a model on `num_labels` classes


```
>>> import torch
>>> from transformers import AutoTokenizer, MvpForSequenceClassification

>>> num_labels = 2  # for example, this is a binary classification task
>>> tokenizer = AutoTokenizer.from_pretrained("RUCAIBox/mvp")
>>> model = MvpForSequenceClassification.from_pretrained("RUCAIBox/mvp", num_labels=num_labels)

>>> inputs = tokenizer("Classify: Hello, my dog is cute", return_tensors="pt")
>>> labels = torch.tensor(1)  # the real label for inputs

>>> loss = model(**inputs, labels=labels).loss
>>> loss.backward()
```

Inference after the model fine-tuned


```
>>> with torch.no_grad():
...     logits = model(**inputs).logits

>>> predicted_class_id = logits.argmax()

Parameters

* **config** ([MvpForQuestionAnswering](/docs/transformers/v4.56.2/en/model_doc/mvp#transformers.MvpForQuestionAnswering)) —
  Model configuration class with all the parameters of the model. Initializing with a config file does not
  load the weights associated with the model, only the configuration. Check out the
  [from\_pretrained()](/docs/transformers/v4.56.2/en/main_classes/model#transformers.PreTrainedModel.from_pretrained) method to load the model weights.

The Mvp transformer with a span classification head on top for extractive question-answering tasks like
SQuAD (a linear layer on top of the hidden-states output to compute `span start logits` and `span end logits`).

This model inherits from [PreTrainedModel](/docs/transformers/v4.56.2/en/main_classes/model#transformers.PreTrainedModel). Check the superclass documentation for the generic methods the
library implements for all its model (such as downloading or saving, resizing the input embeddings, pruning heads
etc.)

This model is also a PyTorch [torch.nn.Module](https://pytorch.org/docs/stable/nn.html#torch.nn.Module) subclass.
Use it as a regular PyTorch Module and refer to the PyTorch documentation for all matter related to general usage
and behavior.

  [What are input IDs?](../glossary#input-ids)
* **attention\_mask** (`torch.Tensor` of shape `(batch_size, sequence_length)`, *optional*) —
  Mask to avoid performing attention on padding token indices. Mask values selected in `[0, 1]`:

* **decoder\_input\_ids** (`torch.LongTensor` of shape `(batch_size, target_sequence_length)`, *optional*) —

  [What are decoder input IDs?](../glossary#decoder-input-ids)

  Mvp uses the `eos_token_id` as the starting token for `decoder_input_ids` generation. If `past_key_values`
  is used, optionally only the last `decoder_input_ids` have to be input (see `past_key_values`).

  For translation and summarization training, `decoder_input_ids` should be provided. If no

  for denoising pre-training following the paper.

  (masked), the loss is only computed for the tokens with labels in `[0, ..., config.vocab_size]`.
* **use\_cache** (`bool`, *optional*) —
  If set to `True`, `past_key_values` key value states are returned and can be used to speed up decoding (see
  `past_key_values`).
* **output\_attentions** (`bool`, *optional*) —
  Whether or not to return the attentions tensors of all attention layers. See `attentions` under returned
  tensors for more detail.
* **output\_hidden\_states** (`bool`, *optional*) —
  Whether or not to return the hidden states of all layers. See `hidden_states` under returned tensors for
  more detail.
* **return\_dict** (`bool`, *optional*) —
  Whether or not to return a [ModelOutput](/docs/transformers/v4.56.2/en/main_classes/output#transformers.utils.ModelOutput) instead of a plain tuple.
* **cache\_position** (`torch.Tensor` of shape `(sequence_length)`, *optional*) —
  Indices depicting the position of the input sequence tokens in the sequence. Contrarily to `position_ids`,
  this tensor is not affected by padding. It is used to update the cache in the correct position and to infer
  the complete sequence length.

Returns

[transformers.modeling\_outputs.CausalLMOutputWithCrossAttentions](/docs/transformers/v4.56.2/en/main_classes/output#transformers.modeling_outputs.CausalLMOutputWithCrossAttentions) or `tuple(torch.FloatTensor)`

A [transformers.modeling\_outputs.CausalLMOutputWithCrossAttentions](/docs/transformers/v4.56.2/en/main_classes/output#transformers.modeling_outputs.CausalLMOutputWithCrossAttentions) or a tuple of
`torch.FloatTensor` (if `return_dict=False` is passed or when `config.return_dict=False`) comprising various
elements depending on the configuration ([MvpConfig](/docs/transformers/v4.56.2/en/model_doc/mvp#transformers.MvpConfig)) and inputs.

* **loss** (`torch.FloatTensor` of shape `(1,)`, *optional*, returned when `labels` is provided) — Language modeling loss (for next-token prediction).
* **logits** (`torch.FloatTensor` of shape `(batch_size, sequence_length, config.vocab_size)`) — Prediction scores of the language modeling head (scores for each vocabulary token before SoftMax).
* **hidden\_states** (`tuple(torch.FloatTensor)`, *optional*, returned when `output_hidden_states=True` is passed or when `config.output_hidden_states=True`) — Tuple of `torch.FloatTensor` (one for the output of the embeddings, if the model has an embedding layer, +
  one for the output of each layer) of shape `(batch_size, sequence_length, hidden_size)`.

  Hidden-states of the model at the output of each layer plus the optional initial embedding outputs.
* **attentions** (`tuple(torch.FloatTensor)`, *optional*, returned when `output_attentions=True` is passed or when `config.output_attentions=True`) — Tuple of `torch.FloatTensor` (one for each layer) of shape `(batch_size, num_heads, sequence_length, sequence_length)`.

  Attentions weights after the attention softmax, used to compute the weighted average in the self-attention
  heads.
* **cross\_attentions** (`tuple(torch.FloatTensor)`, *optional*, returned when `output_attentions=True` is passed or when `config.output_attentions=True`) — Tuple of `torch.FloatTensor` (one for each layer) of shape `(batch_size, num_heads, sequence_length, sequence_length)`.

  Cross attentions weights after the attention softmax, used to compute the weighted average in the
  cross-attention heads.
* **past\_key\_values** (`Cache`, *optional*, returned when `use_cache=True` is passed or when `config.use_cache=True`) — It is a [Cache](/docs/transformers/v4.56.2/en/internal/generation_utils#transformers.Cache) instance. For more details, see our [kv cache guide](https://huggingface.co/docs/transformers/en/kv_cache).

  Contains pre-computed hidden-states (key and values in the attention blocks) that can be used (see
  `past_key_values` input) to speed up sequential decoding.

The [MvpForCausalLM](/docs/transformers/v4.56.2/en/model_doc/mvp#transformers.MvpForCausalLM) forward method, overrides the `__call__` special method.

Although the recipe for forward pass needs to be defined within this function, one should call the `Module`
instance afterwards instead of this since the former takes care of running the pre and post processing steps while
the latter silently ignores them.

Example:


```
>>> from transformers import AutoTokenizer, MvpForCausalLM

>>> tokenizer = AutoTokenizer.from_pretrained("RUCAIBox/mvp")
>>> model = MvpForCausalLM.from_pretrained("RUCAIBox/mvp", add_cross_attention=False)

>>> inputs = tokenizer("Hello, my dog is cute", return_tensors="pt")
>>> outputs = model(**inputs)

>>> logits = outputs.logits
>>> list(logits.shape)
[1, 8, 50267]
```
