# Quark

[Quark](https://quark.docs.amd.com/latest/) is a deep learning quantization toolkit designed to be agnostic to specific data types, algorithms, and hardware. Different pre-processing strategies, algorithms and data-types can be combined in Quark.

The PyTorch support integrated through 🤗 Transformers primarily targets AMD CPUs and GPUs, and is primarily meant to be used for evaluation purposes. For example, it is possible to use [lm-evaluation-harness](https://github.com/EleutherAI/lm-evaluation-harness) with 🤗 Transformers backend and evaluate a wide range of models quantized through Quark seamlessly.

Users interested in Quark can refer to its [documentation](https://quark.docs.amd.com/latest/) to get started quantizing models and using them in supported open-source libraries!

Although Quark has its own checkpoint / [configuration format](https://huggingface.co/amd/Llama-3.1-8B-Instruct-FP8-KV-Quark-test/blob/main/config.json#L26), the library also supports producing models with a serialization layout compliant with other quantization/runtime implementations ([AutoAWQ](https://huggingface.co/docs/transformers/quantization/awq), [native fp8 in 🤗 Transformers](https://huggingface.co/docs/transformers/quantization/finegrained_fp8)).

To be able to load Quark quantized models in Transformers, the library first needs to be installed:


```
pip install amd-quark
```

## Support matrix

Models quantized through Quark support a large range of features, that can be combined together. All quantized models independently of their configuration can seamlessly be reloaded through `PretrainedModel.from_pretrained`.

The table below shows a few features supported by Quark:

| **Feature** | **Supported subset in Quark** |  |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Data types | int8, int4, int2, bfloat16, float16, fp8\_e5m2, fp8\_e4m3, fp6\_e3m2, fp6\_e2m3, fp4, OCP MX, MX6, MX9, bfp16 |  |
| Pre-quantization transformation | SmoothQuant, QuaRot, SpinQuant, AWQ |  |
| Quantization algorithm | GPTQ |  |
| Supported operators | `nn.Linear`, `nn.Conv2d`, `nn.ConvTranspose2d`, `nn.Embedding`, `nn.EmbeddingBag` |  |
| Granularity | per-tensor, per-channel, per-block, per-layer, per-layer type |  |
| KV cache | fp8 |  |
| Activation calibration | MinMax / Percentile / MSE |  |
| Quantization strategy | weight-only, static, dynamic, with or without output quantization |  |

## Models on Hugging Face Hub

Public models using Quark native serialization can be found at <https://huggingface.co/models?other=quark>.

Although Quark also supports [models using `quant_method="fp8"`](https://huggingface.co/models?other=fp8) and [models using `quant_method="awq"`](https://huggingface.co/models?other=awq), Transformers loads these models rather through [AutoAWQ](https://huggingface.co/docs/transformers/quantization/awq) or uses the [native fp8 support in 🤗 Transformers](https://huggingface.co/docs/transformers/quantization/finegrained_fp8).

## Using Quark models in Transformers

Here is an example of how one can load a Quark model in Transformers:


```
from transformers import AutoModelForCausalLM, AutoTokenizer

model_id = "EmbeddedLLM/Llama-3.1-8B-Instruct-w_fp8_per_channel_sym"
model = AutoModelForCausalLM.from_pretrained(model_id, device_map="auto")

print(model.model.layers[0].self_attn.q_proj)
# QParamsLinear(
#   (weight_quantizer): ScaledRealQuantizer()
#   (input_quantizer): ScaledRealQuantizer()
#   (output_quantizer): ScaledRealQuantizer()
# )

tokenizer = AutoTokenizer.from_pretrained(model_id)
inp = tokenizer("Where is a good place to cycle around Tokyo?", return_tensors="pt")
inp = inp.to(model.device)

res = model.generate(**inp, min_new_tokens=50, max_new_tokens=100)

print(tokenizer.batch_decode(res)[0])
# <|begin_of_text|>Where is a good place to cycle around Tokyo? There are several places in Tokyo that are suitable for cycling, depending on your skill level and interests. Here are a few suggestions:
# 1. Yoyogi Park: This park is a popular spot for cycling and has a wide, flat path that's perfect for beginners. You can also visit the Meiji Shrine, a famous Shinto shrine located in the park.
# 2. Imperial Palace East Garden: This beautiful garden has a large, flat path that's perfect for cycling. You can also visit the
