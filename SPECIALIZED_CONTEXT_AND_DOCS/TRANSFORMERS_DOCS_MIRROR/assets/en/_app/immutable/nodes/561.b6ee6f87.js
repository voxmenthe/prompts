checks. So it’s possible that some problems will be missed during a PR submission and get merged. Such problems will
get caught during the next scheduled CI job. But it also means that it’s important to run the slow tests on your
machine before submitting the PR.`,gd,hn,Jc="Here is a rough decision making mechanism for choosing which tests should be marked as slow:",jd,yn,gc=`If the test is focused on one of the library’s internal components (e.g., modeling files, tokenization files,
pipelines), then we should run that test in the non-slow test suite. If it’s focused on an other aspect of the library,
such as the documentation or the examples, then we should run these tests in the slow test suite. And then, to refine
this approach we should have exceptions:`,Cd,Mn,jc=`<li>All tests that need to download a heavy set of weights or a dataset that is larger than ~50MB (e.g., model or
tokenizer integration tests, pipeline integration tests) should be set to slow. If you’re adding a new model, you
should create and upload to the hub a tiny version of it (with random weights) for integration tests. This is
discussed in the following paragraphs.</li> <li>All tests that need to do a training not specifically optimized to be fast should be set to slow.</li> <li>We can introduce exceptions if some of these should-be-non-slow tests are excruciatingly slow, and set them to
<code>@slow</code>. Auto-modeling tests, which save and load large files to disk, are a good example of tests that are marked
as <code>@slow</code>.</li> <li>If a test completes under 1 second on CI (including downloads if any) then it should be a normal test regardless.</li>`,Ud,Tn,Cc=`Collectively, all the non-slow tests need to cover entirely the different internals, while remaining fast. For example,
a significant coverage can be achieved by testing with specially created tiny models with random weights. Such models
have the very minimal number of layers (e.g., 2), vocab size (e.g., 1000), etc. Then the <code>@slow</code> tests can use large
slow models to do qualitative testing. To see the use of these simply look for <em>tiny</em> models with:`,vd,$n,_d,bn,Uc=`Here is an example of a <a href="https://github.com/huggingface/transformers/tree/main/scripts/fsmt/fsmt-make-tiny-model.py" rel="nofollow">script</a> that created the tiny model
<a href="https://huggingface.co/stas/tiny-wmt19-en-de" rel="nofollow">stas/tiny-wmt19-en-de</a>. You can easily adjust it to your specific
model’s architecture.`,Id,Jn,vc=`It’s easy to measure the run-time incorrectly if for example there is an overheard of downloading a huge model, but if
you test it locally the downloaded files would be cached and thus the download time not measured. Hence check the
execution speed report in CI logs instead (the output of <code>pytest --durations=0 tests</code>).`,xd,gn,_c=`That report is also useful to find slow outliers that aren’t marked as such, or which need to be re-written to be fast.
If you notice that the test suite starts getting slow on CI, the top listing of this report will show the slowest
tests.`,kd,jn,Zd,Cn,Ic=`In order to test functions that write to <code>stdout</code> and/or <code>stderr</code>, the test can access those streams using the
<code>pytest</code>’s <a href="https://docs.pytest.org/en/latest/capture.html" rel="nofollow">capsys system</a>. Here is how this is accomplished:`,Hd,Un,Gd,vn,xc=`And, of course, most of the time, <code>stderr</code> will come as a part of an exception, so try/except has to be used in such
a case:`,Bd,_n,Xd,In,kc="Another approach to capturing stdout is via <code>contextlib.redirect_stdout</code>:",Vd,xn,Rd,kn,Zc=`An important potential issue with capturing stdout is that it may contain <code>\\r</code> characters that in normal <code>print</code>
reset everything that has been printed so far. There is no problem with <code>pytest</code>, but with <code>pytest -s</code> these
characters get included in the buffer, so to be able to have the test run with and without <code>-s</code>, you have to make an
extra cleanup to the captured output, using <code>re.sub(r&#39;~.*\\r&#39;, &#39;&#39;, buf, 0, re.M)</code>.`,Nd,Zn,Hc=`But, then we have a helper context manager wrapper to automatically take care of it all, regardless of whether it has
some <code>\\r</code>’s in it or not, so it’s a simple:`,zd,Hn,Wd,Gn,Gc="Here is a full test example:",Ld,Bn,Sd,Xn,Bc="If you’d like to capture <code>stderr</code> use the <code>CaptureStderr</code> class instead:",Qd,Vn,Fd,Rn,Xc="If you need to capture both streams at once, use the parent <code>CaptureStd</code> class:",Ed,Nn,Ad,zn,Vc=`Also, to aid debugging test issues, by default these context managers automatically replay the captured streams on exit
