# dspy.Prediction

## dspy.Prediction

```python
class Prediction(*args, **kwargs)
```

A prediction object that contains the output of a DSPy module.

Prediction inherits from Example.

To allow feedback-augmented scores, Prediction supports comparison operations
(<, >, <=, >=) for Predictions with a `score` field. The comparison operations
compare the 'score' values as floats. For equality comparison, Predictions are equal
if their underlying data stores are equal (inherited from Example).

Arithmetic operations (+, /, etc.) are also supported for Predictions with a 'score'
field, operating on the score value.
