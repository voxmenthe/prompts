# Tutorial: Math Reasoning

Let's walk through a quick example of setting up a `dspy.ChainOfThought` module and optimizing it for answering algebra questions.

Install the latest DSPy via `pip install -U dspy` and follow along. You also need to run `pip install datasets`.

### MLflow DSPy Integration

<a href="https://mlflow.org/">MLflow</a> is an LLMOps tool that natively integrates with DSPy and offer explainability and experiment tracking. In this tutorial, you can use MLflow to visualize prompts and optimization progress as traces to understand the DSPy's behavior better. You can set up MLflow easily by following the four steps below.

1. Install MLflow

```bash
%pip install mlflow>=2.20
```

2. Start MLflow UI in a separate terminal
```bash
mlflow ui --port 5000
```

3. Connect the notebook to MLflow
```python
import mlflow

mlflow.set_tracking_uri("http://localhost:5000")
mlflow.set_experiment("DSPy")
```

4. Enabling tracing.
```python
mlflow.dspy.autolog()
```

Once you have completed the steps above, you can see traces for each program execution on the notebook. They provide great visibility into the model's behavior and helps you understand the DSPy's concepts better throughout the tutorial.

Let's tell DSPy that we will use OpenAI's `gpt-4o-mini` in our modules. To authenticate, DSPy will look into your `OPENAI_API_KEY`. You can easily swap this out for [other providers or local models](https://github.com/stanfordnlp/dspy/blob/main/examples/migration.ipynb).

```python
import dspy

gpt4o_mini = dspy.LM('openai/gpt-4o-mini', max_tokens=2000)
gpt4o = dspy.LM('openai/gpt-4o', max_tokens=2000)
dspy.configure(lm=gpt4o_mini)  # we'll use gpt-4o-mini as the default LM, unless otherwise specified
```

Next, let's load some data examples from the [MATH](https://arxiv.org/abs/2103.03874) benchmark. We'll use a training split for optimization and evaluate it on a held-out dev set.

Please note that the following step will require:
```bash
%pip install git+https://github.com/hendrycks/math.git
```

```python
from dspy.datasets import MATH

dataset = MATH(subset='algebra')
print(len(dataset.train), len(dataset.dev))
```

```text
350 350
```

Let's inspect one example from the training set.

```python
example = dataset.train[0]
print("Question:", example.question)
print("Answer:", example.answer)
```

```text
Question: The doctor has told Cal O'Ree that during his ten weeks of working out at the gym, he can expect each week's weight loss to be $1\%$ of his weight at the end of the previous week. His weight at the beginning of the workouts is $244$ pounds. How many pounds does he expect to weigh at the end of the ten weeks? Express your answer to the nearest whole number.
Answer: 221
```

Now let's define our module. It's extremely simple: just a chain-of-thought step that takes a `question` and produces an `answer`.

```python
module = dspy.ChainOfThought("question -> answer")
module(question=example.question)
```

Next, let's set up an evaluator for the zero-shot module above, before prompt optimization.

```python
THREADS = 24
kwargs = dict(num_threads=THREADS, display_progress=True, display_table=5)
evaluate = dspy.Evaluate(devset=dataset.dev, metric=dataset.metric, **kwargs)

evaluate(module)
```

```text
Average Metric: 259.00 / 350 (74.0%): 100%|â–ˆâ–ˆâ–ˆâ–ˆâ–ˆâ–ˆâ–ˆâ–ˆâ–ˆâ–ˆ| 350/350 [01:30<00:00,  3.85it/s]
```

```text
2024/11/28 18:41:55 INFO dspy.evaluate.evaluate: Average Metric: 259 / 350 (74.0%)
```

```text

```

<details>
<summary>Tracking Evaluation Results in MLflow Experiment</summary>

<br/>

To track and visualize the evaluation results over time, you can record the results in MLflow Experiment.


```python
import mlflow

# Start an MLflow Run to record the evaluation
with mlflow.start_run(run_name="math_evaluation"):
    kwargs = dict(num_threads=THREADS, display_progress=True)
    evaluate = dspy.Evaluate(devset=dataset.dev, metric=dataset.metric, **kwargs)

    # Evaluate the program as usual
    result = evaluate(module)

    # Log the aggregated score
    mlflow.log_metric("correctness", result.score)
    # Log the detailed evaluation results as a table
    mlflow.log_table(
        {
            "Question": [example.question for example in dataset.dev],
            "Gold Answer": [example.answer for example in dataset.dev],
            "Predicted Answer": [output[1] for output in result.results],
            "Correctness": [output[2] for output in result.results],
        },
        artifact_file="eval_results.json",
    )
```

And lastly let's optimize our module. Since we want strong reasoning, we'll use the large GPT-4o as the teacher model (used to bootstrap reasoning for the small LM at optimization time) but not as the prompt model (used to craft instructions) or the task model (trained).

GPT-4o will be invoked only a small number of times. The model involved directly in optimization and in the resulting (optimized) program will be GPT-4o-mini.

We will also specify `max_bootstrapped_demos=4` which means we want at most four bootstrapped examples in the prompt and `max_labeled_demos=4` which means that, in total between bootstrapped and pre-labeled examples, we want at most four.

```python
kwargs = dict(num_threads=THREADS, teacher_settings=dict(lm=gpt4o), prompt_model=gpt4o_mini)
optimizer = dspy.MIPROv2(metric=dataset.metric, auto="medium", **kwargs)

kwargs = dict(max_bootstrapped_demos=4, max_labeled_demos=4)
optimized_module = optimizer.compile(module, trainset=dataset.train, **kwargs)
```

```python
evaluate(optimized_module)
```

```text
Average Metric: 310.00 / 350 (88.6%): 100%|â–ˆâ–ˆâ–ˆâ–ˆâ–ˆâ–ˆâ–ˆâ–ˆâ–ˆâ–ˆ| 350/350 [01:31<00:00,  3.84it/s]
```

```text
2024/11/28 18:59:19 INFO dspy.evaluate.evaluate: Average Metric: 310 / 350 (88.6%)
```

```text

```

Neat. It was pretty straightforward to improve quality from 74% to over 88% on a held-out set here.

That said, for reasoning tasks like this, you will often want to consider more advanced strategies, like:

- A `dspy.ReAct` module with access to a calculator function or `dspy.PythonInterpreter`
- Ensembling multiple optimized prompts with a majority vote (or an Aggregator module) on top


Just to understand what changed, let's view the prompt after optimization. Alternatively, if you enabled MLflow tracing following above instructions, you can compare the prompts before and after optimization in the rich trace UI.

```python
dspy.inspect_history()
```

[[ ## reasoning ## ]]
The equation $|4x+2|=10$ implies two possible equations: $4x+2=10$ or $4x+2=-10$. We solve each equation separately.

1. For $4x+2=10$:
   \[
   4x + 2 = 10 \\
   4x = 8 \\
   x = 2
   \]
   However, $x=2$ does not satisfy the condition $x<0$.

2. For $4x+2=-10$:
   \[
   4x + 2 = -10 \\
   4x = -12 \\
   x = -3
   \]
   The solution $x = -3$ satisfies the condition $x<0$.

Therefore, the value of $x$ is $\boxed{-3}$.

The product of the roots of this quadratic is $-36/1=-36$, so the other solution must be $-36/-4=9$. That means that the sum of the solutions is $-4+9=5$. The sum of the solutions is also $-b/1=-b$. Thus, $-b=5$ and $b=\boxed{-5}$.

[[ ## reasoning ## ]]
Let the length of the playground be $l$ and the width be $w$. We have the equation $2l+2w=200 \Rightarrow l + w = 100$. We want to maximize the area of this rectangular playground, which is given by $lw$. From our equation, we know that $l=100-w$. Substituting this in to our expression for area, we have \[(100-w)(w)=100w-w^2\]We will now complete the square to find the maximum value of this expression. Factoring a $-1$ out, we have \[-(w^2-100w)\]In order for the expression inside the parenthesis to be a perfect square, we need to add and subtract $(100/2)^2=2500$ inside the parenthesis. Doing this, we get \[-(w^2-100w+2500-2500) \Rightarrow -(w-50)^2+2500\]Since the maximum value of $-(w-50)^2$ is 0 (perfect squares are always nonnegative), the maximum value of the entire expression is 2500, which is achieved when $w=50$ and $l=100-w=50$ (the playground is a square). Thus, the maximum area of the playground is $\boxed{2500}$ square feet.

Alice and Bob are playing a game. Alice starts first. On Alice's turn, she flips a coin. If she gets a heads, she wins. If not, it becomes Bob's turn. On Bob's turn, he flips a coin. If he gets a tails, he wins. If not, it becomes Alice's turn. What is the probability that Alice wins the game?

[[ ## reasoning ## ]]
Alice has a $1/2$ chance of winning the game on her first turn. If she doesn't, then the probability that she wins the game on her second turn is $1/8,$ since she must not win on her first flip ($1/2$ chance), Bob must not win on his first flip ($1/2$ chance), and then Alice must win on her second flip ($1/2$ chance). The probability that she wins the game on her third turn is $1/32,$ and in general, the probability that she wins the game on her $k^\text{th}$ turn is $(1/2)^{2k-1}.$ Thus, the probability that Alice wins is an infinite geometric series with first term $1/2$ and common ratio $1/4.$ So, the probability that Alice wins the game is $$\frac{\frac12}{1-\frac14} = \boxed{\frac{2}{3}}.$$OR

Note that the only difference between the odds of Alice or Bob winning is who goes first. Because Bob goes second, the odds of him winning on his $k^\text{th}$ flip is half of the odds that Alice wins on her $k^\text{th}$ flip, since Alice must first get a tails before Bob gets a chance to win. Thus, if $a$ is Alice's chance of winning, and $b$ is Bob's chance of winning, then $a = 2b.$ Also, since someone must win, $a + b = 1.$ It follows that $a = 2/3$ and $b = 1/3,$ so Alice has a $\boxed{\frac{2}{3}}$ chance of winning the game.

Let \( S = \frac{(y-x)^2}{(y-z)(z-x)} + \frac{(z-y)^2}{(z-x)(x-y)} + \frac{(x-z)^2}{(x-y)(y-z)} \).

To find the minimum value of \( S \), we can use the method of symmetry and the Cauchy-Schwarz inequality. 

By applying the Cauchy-Schwarz inequality, we have:
\[
\left( \frac{(y-x)^2}{(y-z)(z-x)} + \frac{(z-y)^2}{(z-x)(x-y)} + \frac{(x-z)^2}{(x-y)(y-z)} \right) \left( (y-z)(z-x) + (z-x)(x-y) + (x-y)(y-z) \right) \geq \left( (y-x) + (z-y) + (x-z) \right)^2.
\]
The right-hand side simplifies to:
\[
(y-x) + (z-y) + (x-z) = 0,
\]
which means the right-hand side is \( 0 \). Therefore, we have:
\[
S \cdot \left( (y-z)(z-x) + (z-x)(x-y) + (x-y)(y-z) \right) \geq 0.
\]
This implies that \( S \) is non-negative.

Next, we can test specific values for \( x, y, z \) to find the minimum. Let's set \( x = 0, y = 1, z = 2 \):
\[
S = \frac{(1-0)^2}{(1-2)(2-0)} + \frac{(2-1)^2}{(2-0)(0-1)} + \frac{(0-2)^2}{(0-1)(1-2)}.
\]
Calculating each term:
1. The first term:
   \[
   \frac{1^2}{(-1)(2)} = \frac{1}{-2} = -\frac{1}{2}.
   \]
2. The second term:
   \[
   \frac{1^2}{(2)(-1)} = \frac{1}{-2} = -\frac{1}{2}.
   \]
3. The third term:
   \[
   \frac{(-2)^2}{(-1)(-1)} = \frac{4}{1} = 4.
   \]

Thus,
\[
S = -\frac{1}{2} - \frac{1}{2} + 4 = 3.
\]

To check if this is indeed the minimum, we can also consider the case when \( x, y, z \) are the roots of a quadratic polynomial. By symmetry and the nature of the expression, we can conclude that the minimum value of \( S \) is indeed \( 3 \).

Therefore, the smallest possible value of \( S \) is \( \boxed{3} \).
