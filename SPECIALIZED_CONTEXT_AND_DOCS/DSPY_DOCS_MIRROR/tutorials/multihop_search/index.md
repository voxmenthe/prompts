# Tutorial: Multi-Hop Retrieval

Let's walk through a quick example of building a `dspy.Module` with multiple sub-modules. We'll do this for the task for multi-hop search.

Install the latest DSPy via `pip install -U dspy` and follow along. You also need to run `pip install datasets`.

### MLflow DSPy Integration

<a href="https://mlflow.org/">MLflow</a> is an LLMOps tool that natively integrates with DSPy and offer explainability and experiment tracking. In this tutorial, you can use MLflow to visualize prompts and optimization progress as traces to understand the DSPy's behavior better. You can set up MLflow easily by following the four steps below.

1. Install MLflow

```bash
%pip install mlflow>=2.20
```

2. Start MLflow UI in a separate terminal
```bash
mlflow ui --port 5000
```

3. Connect the notebook to MLflow
```python
import mlflow

mlflow.set_tracking_uri("http://localhost:5000")
mlflow.set_experiment("DSPy")
```

4. Enabling tracing.
```python
mlflow.dspy.autolog()
```

</details>

In this tutorial, we'll use a small local LM, Meta's `Llama-3.1-8B-Instruct` which has 8 billion parameters.

You might be able to host the 8B model on your laptop with Ollama, on your GPU server with SGLang, or via a provider that hosts it for you like Databricks or Together.

In the snippet below, we'll configure this small model as our main LM. We'll also set up a larger LM, i.e. `GPT-4o`, as a teacher that we'll invoke a very small number of times to help teach the small LM. This is technically not necessary; the small model can typically teach itself tasks like this in DSPy. But using a larger teacher will give us some peace of mind, where the initial system or optimizer configuration doesn't matter as much.

```python
import dspy

lm = dspy.LM('<your_provider>/Llama-3.1-8B-Instruct', max_tokens=3000)
gpt4o = dspy.LM('openai/gpt-4o', max_tokens=3000)

dspy.configure(lm=lm)
```

### Install dependencies and download data

To do the retrieval, we'll use the cool BM25S library, as it's pretty lightweight. You can replace this components with whatever you like.

```shell
> pip install -U bm25s PyStemmer "jax[cpu]"
```

Next, we'll download a snapshot abstracts (i.e., first paragraphs) of all 5,000,000 Wikipedia pages as of 2017. We'll use this as our retrieval corpus.

This is 500MB compressed, so the download and decompression may take 2-3 minutes.

```python
from dspy.utils import download

download("https://huggingface.co/dspy/cache/resolve/main/wiki.abstracts.2017.tar.gz")
!tar -xzvf wiki.abstracts.2017.tar.gz
```

Let's now load the corpus.

```python
import ujson
corpus = []

with open("wiki.abstracts.2017.jsonl") as f:
    for line in f:
        line = ujson.loads(line)
        corpus.append(f"{line['title']} | {' '.join(line['text'])}")

len(corpus)
```

And then let's index it for BM25 retrieval! This will take 2-3 minutes.

```python
import bm25s
import Stemmer

stemmer = Stemmer.Stemmer("english")
corpus_tokens = bm25s.tokenize(corpus, stopwords="en", stemmer=stemmer)

retriever = bm25s.BM25(k1=0.9, b=0.4)
retriever.index(corpus_tokens)
```

### Load the HoVer dataset.

Let's load a dataset for our task. We'll load examples from the HoVer multi-hop task, where the input is a (really!) complex claim and the output we're seeking is the set of Wikipedia pages that are required to fact-check that claim.

```python
import random
from dspy.datasets import DataLoader

kwargs = dict(fields=("claim", "supporting_facts", "hpqa_id", "num_hops"), input_keys=("claim",))
hover = DataLoader().from_huggingface(dataset_name="vincentkoc/hover-parquet", split="train", trust_remote_code=True, **kwargs)

hpqa_ids = set()
hover = [
    dspy.Example(claim=x.claim, titles=list(set([y["key"] for y in x.supporting_facts]))).with_inputs("claim")
    for x in hover
    if x["num_hops"] == 3 and x["hpqa_id"] not in hpqa_ids and not hpqa_ids.add(x["hpqa_id"])
]

random.Random(0).shuffle(hover)
trainset, devset, testset = hover[:200], hover[200:500], hover[650:]
```

Let's view an example of this task:

```python
example = trainset[0]

print("Claim:", example.claim)
print("Pages that must be retrieved:", example.titles)
```

```text
Claim: This director is known for his work on Miss Potter. The Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences presents the award in which he was nominated for his work in "Babe".
Pages that must be retrieved: ['Miss Potter', 'Chris Noonan', 'Academy Award for Best Director']
```

Now, let's define a function to do the search in Wikipedia. This will use our BM25 index.

```python
def search(query: str, k: int) -> list[str]:
    tokens = bm25s.tokenize(query, stopwords="en", stemmer=stemmer, show_progress=False)
    results, scores = retriever.retrieve(tokens, k=k, n_threads=1, show_progress=False)
    run = {corpus[doc]: float(score) for doc, score in zip(results[0], scores[0])}
    return run
```

Now, let's define the multi-hop program in DSPy. It's going to be super simple: it'll take a `claim` and produce a list `titles: list[str]`.

It will do this via two sub-modules: `generate_query` and `append_notes`.

```python
class Hop(dspy.Module):
    def __init__(self, num_docs=10, num_hops=4):
        self.num_docs, self.num_hops = num_docs, num_hops
        self.generate_query = dspy.ChainOfThought('claim, notes -> query')
        self.append_notes = dspy.ChainOfThought('claim, notes, context -> new_notes: list[str], titles: list[str]')

    def forward(self, claim: str) -> list[str]:
        notes = []
        titles = []

        for _ in range(self.num_hops):
            query = self.generate_query(claim=claim, notes=notes).query
            context = search(query, k=self.num_docs)
            prediction = self.append_notes(claim=claim, notes=notes, context=context)
            notes.extend(prediction.new_notes)
            titles.extend(prediction.titles)
        
        return dspy.Prediction(notes=notes, titles=list(set(titles)))
```

Great. Now let's set up an evaluation metric, `top5_recall`.

It will return the fraction of the gold pages (which are always 3) that are retrieved in the top-5 titles returned by the program.

```python
def top5_recall(example, pred, trace=None):
    gold_titles = example.titles
    recall = sum(x in pred.titles[:5] for x in gold_titles) / len(gold_titles)

    # If we're "bootstrapping" for optimization, return True if and only if the recall is perfect.
    if trace is not None:
        return recall >= 1.0
    
    # If we're just doing inference, just measure the recall.
    return recall

evaluate = dspy.Evaluate(devset=devset, metric=top5_recall, num_threads=16, display_progress=True, display_table=5)
```

Let's evaluate our off-the-shelf program!

```python
evaluate(Hop())
```

```text

        display_progress=True,
    )

    # Evaluate the program as usual
    result = evaluate(Hop())

    # Log the aggregated score
    mlflow.log_metric("top5_recall", result.score)
    # Log the detailed evaluation results as a table
    mlflow.log_table(

Let's now optimize the two prompts inside the `Hop()` program jointly to maximize the recall of our program. This may take around 35 minutes and make some $5 worth of calls to GPT-4o to optimize Llama-3.1-8B.

```python
models = dict(prompt_model=gpt4o, teacher_settings=dict(lm=gpt4o))
tp = dspy.MIPROv2(metric=top5_recall, auto="medium", num_threads=16, **models)

kwargs = dict(minibatch_size=40, minibatch_full_eval_steps=4)
optimized = tp.compile(Hop(), trainset=trainset, max_bootstrapped_demos=4, max_labeled_demos=4, **kwargs)
```

Let's now evaluate again, after optimization.

```python
evaluate(optimized)
```

Awesome. It looks like the system improved drastically from around 30% recall to a little below 60% recall. That was a pretty straightforward approach, but DSPy gives you many tools to continue iterating on this from here.

Next, let's inspect the optimized prompts to understand what it has learned. We'll run one query and then inspect the last two prompts, which will show us the prompts used for both sub-modules, in the later iteration inside the `Hop()` program. (Alternatively, if you enabled MLflow Tracing following the instructions above, you can see all steps done by the agent including LLM calls, prompts, tool execution, in a rich tree-view.)

```python
optimized(claim="The author of the 1960s unproduced script written for The Beatles, Up Against It, and Bernard-Marie Koltès are both playwrights.").titles
```

```python
dspy.inspect_history(n=2)
```

From the context, we know that Zak Ové's father is Horace Ové, who is indeed a photographer among other professions. However, A. Edward Sutherland is not mentioned as a photographer in the context; he is known as a film director. Therefore, the claim is correct because Horace Ové is a photographer, but A. Edward Sutherland is not.
