# Tutorial: ProgramOfThought

`dspy.ProgramOfThought` automatically generates and refines Python code to solve downstream tasks.

Install the latest DSPy via `pip install -U dspy` and follow along.

## 1) Using PythonInterpreter

`ProgramOfThought` integrates an adapted Python interpreter to execute code generated by LMs. 

As a brief example to demonstrate how the interpreter works, we'll create an instance of `dspy.PythonInterpreter` and demonstrate the underlying execution of `ProgramOfThought`.

```python
import dspy
interpreter = dspy.PythonInterpreter()
expr = "value = 2*5 + 4\nvalue"
answer = interpreter.execute(expr)
answer
```

## 2) Demonstrating ProgramOfThought
 As an example, we'll define a signature with an input question and an output answer. Then, we'll create and invoke the `ProgramOfThought` program, which uses an LM to first generate code to represent the question, executes the code using the interpreter and outputs the final result as the answer to the question.

Let's use Meta's `Llama-3-70b-Instruct`. You can easily swap this out for [other providers or local models](https://github.com/stanfordnlp/dspy/blob/main/examples/migration.ipynb).

```python
llama31_70b = dspy.LM("openai/meta-llama/Meta-Llama-3-70b-Instruct", api_base="API_BASE", api_key="None")

dspy.settings.configure(lm=llama31_70b)
```

Let's now define our module with a brief signature that specifies the input question and output answer. We can then call `ProgramOfThought` on the signature and pass in our sample problem.

```python
class BasicGenerateAnswer(dspy.Signature):
    question = dspy.InputField()
    answer = dspy.OutputField()

pot = dspy.ProgramOfThought(BasicGenerateAnswer)
problem = "2*5 + 4"
pot(question=problem).answer
```

Great! The module successfully produced the same correct answer. Let's see how exactly it used the LM to do so:

```python
dspy.inspect_history()
```

## 3) Comparing with ChainOfThought

Now we turn to a more complex problem to demonstrate how the `ProgramOfThought` module can be helpful. 

Problem: **Compute 12! / sum of prime numbers between 1 and 30.**

This is a fairly challenging computation. Let's see how `ChainOfThought` performs first:

```python
problem = "Compute 12! / sum of prime numbers between 1 and 30."

cot = dspy.ChainOfThought(BasicGenerateAnswer)
cot(question=problem).answer
```

```python
dspy.inspect_history()

To solve this problem, we need to calculate 12! (12 factorial) and the sum of prime numbers between 1 and 30. 

First, let's calculate 12!. 12! = 12 * 11 * 10 * 9 * 8 * 7 * 6 * 5 * 4 * 3 * 2 * 1 = 479,001,600.

Next, let's find the prime numbers between 1 and 30. The prime numbers between 1 and 30 are 2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13, 17, 19, 23, and 29. 

Now, let's calculate the sum of these prime numbers. sum = 2 + 3 + 5 + 7 + 11 + 13 + 17 + 19 + 23 + 29 = 129.

Finally, let's calculate 12! / sum of prime numbers between 1 and 30. result = 479,001,600 / 129 = 3,710,009. 

[[ ## answer ## ]]
3,710,009

[[ ## completed ## ]][0m





```

So `ChainOfThought` does fairly well in reasoning through the steps, getting the correct value for both 12! and the sum of only prime numbers between 1-30. 

But it fails at the last step of division, incorrectly computing `479,001,600 / 129 = 3,710,009` when the correct answer is `3713190.69767` (verified by a real calculator!)

Let's see how `ProgramOfThought` fares:

```python
pot(question=problem).answer
```

The problem requires us to compute the value of 12! divided by the sum of prime numbers between 1 and 30. To solve this, we first need to calculate the factorial of 12 and the sum of prime numbers between 1 and 30. We can use the formulas for factorial and prime numbers to achieve this. The factorial of a number n (denoted as n!) is the product of all positive integers less than or equal to n. A prime number is a natural number greater than 1 that has no positive divisors other than 1 and itself. We can use these definitions to write functions to calculate the factorial and sum of prime numbers. Finally, we can divide the factorial of 12 by the sum of prime numbers to get the final result.

With the Python interpreter executing code accurately, `ProgramOfThought` mitigates computation errors that may fail in `ChainOfThought`, improving correctness particularly for numerical and logical queries.

## 3) Computation with Contextual Reasoning

Now let's try a more complex example of doing computation in complex math word problems. 

### Step 1: Define a helper function to search Wikipedia
We'll use a `dspy.ColBERTv2` server to retrieve top matches from Wikipedia and parse them inside the `ProgramOfThought` pipeline.

```python
def search_wikipedia(query: str):
    results = dspy.ColBERTv2(url='http://20.102.90.50:2017/wiki17_abstracts')(query, k=3)
    return [x['text'] for x in results]
```

### Step 2: Multi-Hop Search with ProgramOfThought
We'll take inspiration from the [Multi-Hop Search task](https://dspy.ai/tutorials/multihop_search/) and simply tweak the final `generate_answer` layer to use `ProgramOfThought` in place of `ChainOfThought` to ensure accurate computations given a question and retrieved context.

We pose a challenging word problem that requires retrieval to gather information and then use the facts to perform computation and produce a final result. 

```python
class GenerateAnswer(dspy.Signature):
    """Answer questions with short factoid answers."""

    context = dspy.InputField(desc="may contain relevant facts")
    question = dspy.InputField()
    answer = dspy.OutputField(desc="often between 1 and 5 words")


class GenerateSearchQuery(dspy.Signature):
    """Write a simple search query that will help answer the non-numerical components of a complex question."""

    context = dspy.InputField(desc="may contain relevant facts")
    question = dspy.InputField()
    query = dspy.OutputField()

from dspy.dsp.utils import deduplicate

class MultiHopSearchWithPoT(dspy.Module):
    def __init__(self, num_hops):
        self.num_hops = num_hops
        self.generate_query = dspy.ChainOfThought(GenerateSearchQuery)
        self.generate_answer = dspy.ProgramOfThought(GenerateAnswer, max_iters=3)

    def forward(self, question):
        context = []
        for _ in range(self.num_hops):
            query = self.generate_query(context=context, question=question).query
            context = deduplicate(context + search_wikipedia(query))
        prediction = self.generate_answer(context=context, question=question)
        return dspy.Prediction(context=context, answer=prediction.answer)

multi_hop_pot = MultiHopSearchWithPoT(num_hops=2)
question = (
    "What is the square of the total sum of the atomic number of the metal "
    "that makes up the gift from France to the United States in the late "
    "19th century and the sum of the number of digits in the first 10 prime numbers?"
)
multi_hop_pot(question=question).answer

The statue was constructed in only four days out of foam and papier-mâché over a metal armature. The constructors decided to make the statue as large as possible to try to dissuade the government from dismantling it: the government would either have to destroy the statue—an action which would potentially fuel further criticism of its policies—or leave it standing. Nevertheless, the statue was destroyed on June 4, 1989, by soldiers clearing the protesters from Tiananmen square.

The problem requires us to find the square of the total sum of the atomic number of the metal that makes up the gift from France to the United States in the late 19th century and the sum of the number of digits in the first 10 prime numbers. The gift from France to the United States is the Statue of Liberty, which is made of copper. The atomic number of copper is 29. The first 10 prime numbers are 2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13, 17, 19, 23, and 29. The sum of the number of digits in these prime numbers is 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 2 + 2 + 2 + 2 + 2 + 2 = 14. The total sum is 29 + 14 = 43. The square of the total sum is 43^2 = 1849. However, the code output is 2025, which indicates that the code is correct and the manual calculation is incorrect.

Notice how the retrieved context includes passages about the Statue Liberty and copper. This retrieval helps with answering the first part of the question, identifying the Statue of Liberty as the gift from France to the US in the late 19th century, determines it is made of copper, and retrieves the atomic number of copper (29) through step-by-step reasoning.

The second part of the question is broken down into Python logic, summing the number of digits in the first 10 prime numbers programmatically.

By combining these two subproblems, the solution correctly aggregates the results and outputs the final answer: **2025**.
